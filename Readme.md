# About

>This was developed for reading using the markdown reader called obsidian, found [here](https://obsidian.md/).

Basically, each branch builds upon the last, this branch builds upon `a+`. All of the notes from `a+` are here, mainly for reference and hyperlinks.

>Notes are taken from [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnlCJiCrOYuRYb6cne864a7G).

Here is what each folder contains:

- `!PDFs` contains PDFs (primarily exam outlines)
- `!Pictures` contains images for the markdown files
- `cloud/` contains information about cloud technologies, acronyms, features, etc.
- `computer hardware/` contains information about computer related hardware
- `devices` contains information about phones, networking equipment (routers, switches, etc.) and printers
- `devices/` contains information about phones and printers
- `hacking/` contains information about attacks, viruses, malware, etc.
- `interfaces/` contains information about device interfaces, ports and cables
- `issues and troubleshooting/` contains information about common issues (BSOD, overheating, etc.) and their solutions
- `networking/` contains information about networking hardware, IP addressing, protocols (SSH, telnet, FTP, etc.) and things like Bluetooth, wiring standards, physical networking tools, etc.
- `operating systems/` contains information about (primarily) Windows & Linux, things such as:
	- tools
	- features
	- hardware and software support
	- cross-operating system compatibility
	- IT administrator concepts (active directory, group policy, etc.)
- `security/` contains information about security systems and practices
- `standards/` contains information about standards like IEEE, wiring standards and protocols
- `storage devices/` contains information about storage devices

>My goal is to continuously expand the information contained within this branch as I progress onto future exams e.g., networking+, security+.
>Kind of like a taste of future concepts to get you accustomed to thinking in a certain mindset and for my own benefit.

## Disclaimer

These are the notes that I personally used and will use to study and write the CompTIA a+ exam, some notes or information might be slightly incorrect. I blame the materials I studied with or sometimes, various websites say different things and it's a little hard to trust one single source (unless you know it by heart).

These notes are designed for me and me personally, by reading these notes you get to enjoy my personal views and commentaries along with useful bits of information not pertaining to the exam but are useful to know regardless.

This is also not completely comprehensive, this doesn't cover *all* topics for the certification. I'd recommend studying more on top of this, and having IT experience in general.

>Enjoy.
