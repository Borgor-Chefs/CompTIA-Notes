# About

>This was developed for reading using the markdown reader called obsidian, found [here](https://obsidian.md/).

This branch is for notes on how to pass the CompTIA a+ certification exam.

Here is what each folder contains:

- `cloud/` contains information about cloud technologies, acronyms, features, etc.
- `common issues/` contains information about common issues (BSOD, overheating, etc.) and their solutions
- `hardware/` contains information about all types of hardware (hard drives, expansion cards, laptop, CPUs, CDs, motherboards, etc.)
- `networking/` contains information about networking hardware, IP addressing, protocols (SSH, telnet, FTP, etc.) and things like Bluetooth, wiring standards, physical networking tools, etc.
- `operating systems/` contains information about (primarily) Windows & Linux, things such as:
	- tools
	- features
	- hardware and software support
	- cross-operating system compatibility
	- IT administrator concepts (active directory, group policy, etc.)
- `PDFs` contains PDFs (primarily exam outlines)
- `pictures` contains images for the markdown files

>My goal is to continuously expand the information contained within this branch as I progress onto future exams e.g., networking+, security+.
>Kind of like a taste of future concepts to get you accustomed to thinking in a certain mindset and for my own benefit.

## Disclaimer

These are the notes that I personally use to study for my CompTIA a+ exam, some notes or information might be slightly incorrect. I blame the materials I studied with or sometimes, various websites say different things and it's hard to trust one single source (unless you know it by heart).

These notes are designed for me and me personally, by reading these notes you get to enjoy my personal views and commentaries along with useful bits of information not pertaining to the exam but are useful to know regardless.

>Enjoy.
