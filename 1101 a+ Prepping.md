## What Is...

### Mobile Devices

### Networking

- load balancer
- proxy
- spam gateway
- unified threat management
- IoT device

### Hardware

- form factor
	- 2.5
	- 3.5
	- M.2
	- mSATA
- RAID 0, 1, 5 and 10
- NVMe drive
- PCIe
- trusted platform module (TPM)
	- provides a hardware random number generator
	- stores cryptographic keys
	- hashes the software and hardware configuration to ensure nothing has been changed
	- can authenticate hardware devices and software
- hardware security module (HSM)
	- this is a dedicated device for managing security keys, it also performs cryptographic functions like hashing and encrypting
- multi threading
- input 110-120 VAC v.s. 220-240 VAC (more importantly what is VAC)
	- 110 VAC means 110 volts AC power
	- higher voltage allows the usage of thinner wires
- output 3.3V v.s. 5V v.s. 12V
- 20-pin to 24-pin motherboard adapter
- redundant power supply
- modular power supply
- wattage rating

### Virtualization & Cloud Computing

- cloud models
	- private, public, hybrid, community cloud
	- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
	- software as a service (SaaS)
	- platform as a service (PaaS)
- cloud characteristics
	- shared resources
	- metered utilization
	- rapid elasticity
	- high availability
	- file synchronization
- desktop virtualization
	- virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) on premises
	- VDI in the cloud
- purpose of virtual machines
	- sandboxing
	- test development
	- application virtualization
		- legacy software/OS
		- cross-platform virtualization
	- resource requirements
	- security requirements

### Hardware and Network Troubleshooting

Apply the best practice methodology to resolve problems

- always consider corporate policies, procedures and impacts before implementing changes
	- identify the problem
		- gather information from the user, identify user changes and make backups when needed
		- inrequire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes
	- establish a thoery of probable cause (question the obvious)
		- conduct external or internal research based on symptoms
	- test the theory to determine the cause
		- once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to solve it
		- if the theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory or escalate
	- establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
	- verify the functionality, and if applicable, implement preventative measures
	- document the findings, actions and outcomes
