# The Solid State Drive (SDD)

This is meant to be a purely electronic, almost successor to the HDD. An SSD has no moving parts and it uses memory chips instead of magnetized platters to store data.

The data transfer is very fast.

A SSD typically uses [[Flash Memory|flash memory]] as the base of its storage technology.
