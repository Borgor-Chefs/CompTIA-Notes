# Blueray

The latest optical drive which was released in 2006.

Blueray will eventually replace the DVD since it can store far more data. The standard Blueray disk can store up to 25 GB worth of data.

The difference between Blueray disk and a DVD is that Blueray uses a shorter wavelength laser to burn data onto the disk.
