# The CD-RW

This stands for "Compact Disk, Rewritable" and is a successor to the CD-ROM.

Inside the component there is a laser assembly which writes or "burns" data onto the CD.

There are two types of rewriteable media:

- CD-R: which stands for "Compact Disk, Recordable" which can only be written to once.
- CD-RW: which stands for "Compact Disk, Rewriteable" which allows data to be written to it multiple times.

A CD can hold upto 700 MB of data.
