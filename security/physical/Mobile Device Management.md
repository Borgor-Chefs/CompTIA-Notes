# Mobile Device Management (MDM)

This manages company-owned and user-owned mobile devices. This enables centralization of the functionality on your device by the company.

>This can be troublesome because an IT person won't know how well the company is storing your personal information or if the company is actually spying on you.

Companies can set policies on your phone such as:

- install apps
- determine what hardware is enabled or disabled and when
    - wi-fi capabilities
    - cellular capabilities
    - camera

Companies will either control the entire device or a specific partition of your device. If a company manages just a partition, this is actually better because if you ever decide to leave, they can blow away the partition with the company data on it and leave your personal data intact.
