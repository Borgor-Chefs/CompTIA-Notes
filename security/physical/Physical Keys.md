These are example of physical "keys" (something that unlocks something else) for staff or authorized people that need to traverse a data centre.

Some types of keys are:

- key fobs: a small little [[RFID]] device
    - good to distribute to employees so they can navigate through a facility
- smart cards: a credit-card that can be scanned for authentication
    - there is a certificate or a unique ID stored on the little chip on the card
    - this is "something you have"
    - it's bad practice to only rely on this, so it's usually paired with "something you know" like a PIN or password
- keys: an actual key, like lock & key
    - these are apparently rarely used and **should ever only** open one lock
    - if many people need many keys, they should be stored in a key-cabinet
    - a good way to ensure that people return the key after their done with it is by having them trade something like their phone, car keys or something that will identify them
    - another good way is to write it down or, use an electronic system wherein you have to badge in to open the key cabinet and the system will record what key was taken or put back (I've seen this first hand)
