# Closed Circuit Television

You ever walk into a place and see cameras everywhere? That's CCTV. These are security cameras that monitor a given angle or area somewhere in a facility or building.

>The video says that these cameras can "replace physical guards" which may be true for monitoring purposes, but I don't think that this is a good idea. Maybe for low-risk environments.

Why is it called "closed circuit"? Because these cameras (as they shouldn't) don't have any wireless capabilities. Which is a good idea because these cameras would thus be vulnerable to wireless attacks. Instead, these cameras are wired into the building itself in closed [[Network Types|LAN]], using only physical methods of data transfer, no wireless.

## Features

These cameras are designed to monitor an area 24/7, and the video they record is sent to some central location which is then viewed (usually) on a single monitor.

Some of these cameras can employ the following technologies:

- facial recognition
- object classification
- optical character recognition (e.g., reading a license plate from a car in real-time)
- sound recording

>The first three technologies use machine-learning to order to process the video information being sent to them (this type of technology really isn't possible with other foundations).
>The cameras don't do this type of processing themselves, but rather a central command and control center connected to the closed network.

Now, what comes next are my own thoughts and intuitions which can differ from reality:

Depending on location, most of the cameras you'll see are just regular cameras that record video and maybe audio. Mainly for low-risk environments, I've seen this first hand.

But for locations say police stations, they'll probably have more sophisticated cameras that employ facial recognition, sound, optical character recognition, etc.

>Now I can say from personal experience that a lot of these CCTV cameras have low video resolution. This is most likely relative to their cost.

## Types

Some cameras:

- have a 360 degree view of its surroundings
- only monitor one single angle
- are motion-activated using radio reflection or passive infrared
