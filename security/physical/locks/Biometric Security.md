# Biometric Security

Biometric security functions well because no two humans are the same (at least they shouldn't be). There are many types of biometrics:

- retina scanner
    - relies on the unique capillary structure in the back of the eye
- fingerprint scanner
    - relies on the unique structure of your finger
    - you can find these on phones, laptops and [[Door Locks|door locks]]
- palmprint scanner
    - relies on the unique structure of your hand

This type of security should store a mathematical representation of your biometric (fingerprint, retina, etc.). I wouldn't say this is a guarantee that your actual eye, fingerprint or palmprint isn't stored somewhere.

Biometric security isn't foolproof, this is why biometrics are usually combined with another form of authentication like a PIN, a password, etc.
