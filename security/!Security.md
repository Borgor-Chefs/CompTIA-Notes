# About Security

This folder is about physical and virtual security systems and protocols. Everything you'll need for the A+ exam.

- the `physical/` folder contains everything that's physical such as keys, barricades, fences, etc.
- the `virtual/` folder contains everything that's software-based such as email filtering, access control lists, protocols, etc.
- for MFA, see [[Multi-Factor Authentication]]
- for least privilege, a security practice, see [[Least Privilege]]
