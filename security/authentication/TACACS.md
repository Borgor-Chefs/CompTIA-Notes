# Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS)

This is a remote authentication protocol that was created to control access to dial-up lines to ARPANET (something that's really fucking old).

TACACS is most commonly associated with Cisco devices, but it was released as an open standard in 1993.

## TACACS+

The latest version of TACACS with more authentication requests and response codes.
