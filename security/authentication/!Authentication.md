# About Authentication

This folder is all about authentication protocols and programs. The main thing to know here is AAA which stands for "authentication, authorization & accounting."

- Authentication is getting access to the building, network or thing you need i.e., getting your foot in the door
- Authorization is accessing something in said building, network or thing i.e., are you allowed to have access to this despite your authentication?
- Accounting is purely logging i.e., John Doe accessed file share XXX at March 16th 2023

Whenever a protocol talks to an authentication server, IT people call that an AAA protocol.
