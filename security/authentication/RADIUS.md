# Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)

Despite the name including "dial-in", you don't have to use a dial-up modem to actually connect to it.

This is also known as a AAA protocol, where AAA stands for authentication, authorization and accounting. Whenever a protocol talks to an authentication server, IT people call that an AAA protocol.

This is very useful as it centralizes all requests for authentication on your network to a single machine, without this, you would have to manually configure authentication for every single device on your network.

Having "dial-in" in the name, RADIUS has been around for a long time, that being said, it has a lot of support in the industry. The video I watched said that most if not all devices will support RADIUS authentication.
