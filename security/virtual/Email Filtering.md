# Email Filtering

This stops unsolicited emails from reaching the user, since users aren't the most tech-savvy or brightest people. Email filtering blocks or deletes suspicious emails. This is either done on-site or is cloud-based.

A setup can look like this:

- the email is sent to an email relay
- the email relay will analyze the email
- if the email is determined to be spam, reject it
- if the email is determined to not be spam, allow it through

This can help protect users from:

- malicious executables, known vulnerabilities
- phishing attempts
- other unwanted content such as porn, scams, junk mail, etc.
