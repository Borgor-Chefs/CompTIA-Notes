# Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)

>See more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_Key_Integrity_Protocol).

Because of [[WEP]] using a single preset, manually entered key this protocol was invented. What this does is create a unique per-packet key to ensure that no packet is encrypted the same.

This protocol was deprecated by the IEEE in January 2009.
