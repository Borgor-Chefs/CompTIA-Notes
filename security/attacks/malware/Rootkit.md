# Rootkits

This was originally a [[Operating Systems Overview#Linux|Unix]] technique, this type of malware embeds itself deep into the computer, typically into the kernel itself. It's designed to become apart of your computer system such that no anti-virus will even be able to detect it.

## Finding Rootkits

This is more or less trial and error since it's not necessarily common for you to notice an installed rootkit. However, if you notice odd things happening to your computer and you somehow discover a rootkit and the type of rootkit. You can remove it using a third-party tool.

## Why Don't We See Rootkits Anymore?

>They still exist, but are far fewer in number.

The reason is because of UEFI security and Secure Boot. These are security tools built into the [[The BIOS|BIOS]] that verify your kernel and required operating system programs before booting.
