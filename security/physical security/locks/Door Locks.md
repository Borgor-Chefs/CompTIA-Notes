- deadbolt: a physical large bolt that extends from inside the door into the door frame
- electronic: keyless PIN-type locks
- token-based: [[RFID]] badge, magnetic swipe or a key fob
- [[Biometric Security|biometrics]]: hand, finger or retina
- multi-factor: a combination of previous lock types
    - e.g., scan fingerprint, enter PIN and finally swipe a card
