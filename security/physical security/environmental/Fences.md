# Fences

>A literal fence.

This is to build a perimeter and to direct traffic into a certain place or area. This is a very obvious type of security but still effective if not a deterrent.

Fences can be transparent (can see through the bars) or opaque (something like a concrete fence that you cannot see through). These fences are usually quite robust and you can usually not cut through these. The exception here is using heavy machinery.

Finally, the fences are primarily used to prevent climbing. Some methods to prevent this:

- razor wire at the top (or something else that's sharp)
- building a high fence
- slippery or a uneasily climbable material
- electrification
