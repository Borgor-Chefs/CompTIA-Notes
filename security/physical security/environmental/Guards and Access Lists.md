# Guards & Access Lists

This is literally just a registry of all people who are allowed to be present within a building and in what areas. This list is (nowadays) most likely electronic with a picture of the person, so that there cannot be any impostors running around.

Usually, there will be a security guard who will permit/deny you access into the building based on your ID badge and who you are. An ID badge will usually have:

- your name
- a picture of yourself
- some other details
- maybe an [[RFID]] chip inside to allow you to badge in/out of certain places

There is also (usually) an visitor's log which tracks who entered or left and at what time.
