# Lighting

Lighting is actually quite useful as people are revealed by light and attackers usually try to avoid it (a subtle tell if you're a security guard). Also, [[Infrared|infrared cameras]] can see better in better light.

Lighting is only useful if:

- it can reveal or enhance facial structure or details
- avoid or reduce shadows or glare
- reveal or enhance vehicles information such as license plates
