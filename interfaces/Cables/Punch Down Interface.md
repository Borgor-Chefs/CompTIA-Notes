# Punch Down Patch Panel

>Guide to punch down an ethernet cable, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbRigKjwGwM).

These are [[Patch Panel|patch panels]] that, on one side, have a "punch down" interface and the other is an [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45)|RJ-45]] port.

A "punch down" interface is somewhat of a freehand place where you put the internal wires of a [[Cable Standards|digital cable]]. The grooves in the above image are where you put your wires, the image shows what configuration to put these cables in.

## 66 Block

This is a patch panel with 66 connections that's used for analog voice connections (and some digital links). The left side is patched to the right. All you need is some wires and a [[Tools#Punch Down Tool|punch down tool]].

These aren't really used anymore, what's more common now are [[#110 Blocks]].

## 110 Blocks

This is a wire-to-wire [[Patch Panel]] with no intermediate interface required. This also replaces the [[#66 Block]] and supports [[Ethernet Standard|category 5 and 6]] cables..

The shielding is still present around the wires mind you. The metallic teeth in the groove pierce the shielding thus making contact with the copper inside the cable.

## Krone Block

These are an alternative to the [[#110 Blocks|110 block]] but only found in Europe. These support analog and digital communication with different models supporting higher frequencies.

## Building Industry Cross-Connect (BIX) Block

This is another type of block type created by the 1970s by Northern Telecom which is still being updated to this date. The latest block of this type is the GigaBIX block which supports [[Ethernet Standard|category 6]] cables.
