>The links for firewire, USB and thunderbolt have their own notes as they are better suited there. They are connectors, the cable medium itself is something almost entirely different.

## Connectors

### Register Jack 11 (RJ-11)

The RJ-11 is a 4-wire telephone jack used for connecting phones to landlines. This type of cable is also used to connect modems on computers. Used to connect computers to [[Network Types#Local Area Network (LAN)|LANs]] through the computer's [[Networking Hardware#Modems|modem]]. It locks itself in place using a hinged locking tab.

This connector resembles the [[#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45) (Ethernet Cable)|RJ-45]] connector but smaller.

### Register Jack 45 (RJ-45)

This is the most common networking connector, its most common use is to connect a computer to a [[Network Types#Local Area Network (LAN)|local area network]]. It is used to attach [[Network Interface Card|network interface cards]] to hubs or switches.

This resembles the [[#Register Jack 11 (RJ-11)|RJ-11]] but larger. It also used twisted pair cabling.

## Twisted Pair Cables

As far as I can tell, these cables are mainly used for networking. You'd find these (for sure) with [[Ethernet Port|ethernet cables]].

### Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) Cable

This is the most common type of cable used today, wires are twisted around each other to prevent EM interference (crosstalk). The greater number of twists, the better prevention of interference.

### Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) Cable

This is basically the exact same as an UTP cable however, there is a layer of metal shielding which surrounds the wires. This shielding adds a later of protection against EM interference.
