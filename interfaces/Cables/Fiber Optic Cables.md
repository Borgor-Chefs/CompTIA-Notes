# Fiber Optic Cable

These cables use light, specifically the visible light spectrum to transmit data over a physical medium. The signal is also slow to degrade which makes it perfect for transmission over long distances.

There's no RF signal, making it harder (not impossible) to monitor or tap. And because there's no RF signal, it's immune to RF interference.

## Anatomy

The cable itself is made up of three parts;

- the core
- the cladding
- the buffer coating

>The above is an example of a [[#Standard/Subscriber Connector (SC)|SC]] cable.

The "ferrule" surrounds the fiber core to protect it from damage and interference.

### Connectors

#### Straight Tip (ST)

This is a fiber optic cable connector and uses a half-twist bayonet type of lock. Commonly used with single-mode fiber optic cable.

#### Local/Lucent Connector (LC)

This is another fiber optic cable like the [[#Straight Tip (ST)|ST connector]] and is similar to the [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45) (Ethernet Cable)|RJ-45]] style of connector. This is commonly used between floors on a building.

#### Standard/Subscriber Connector (SC)

![[Pasted image 20220828205838.png]]

This is a fiber optic cable that uses a push-pull connector similar to [[Coaxial Cables#RCA|audio and video plugs]]. Like the [[#Local/Lucent Connector (LC)|LC connector]] it is also used between the floors of a building.

### Cable Types

Between these two cable types, the [[#Single-mode Fiber (SMF)|single mode fiber]] has a much denser cladding than the [[#Multi-mode Fiber (MMF)|multi-mode fiber]].

#### Single-mode Fiber (SMF)

This type of cable only allows light to enter it at a certain angle and at certain wavelength. This uses an expensive light source such as a laser.

This is used for long-range communication up to 100km.

#### Multi-mode Fiber (MMF)

This type of cable allows light to reflect off the walls of the cable and usually uses an inexpensive light source like an LED. It is called "multi-mode" fiber because it allows for various wavelengths of light to be passed through.

This is used for short-range communication up to 2km.
