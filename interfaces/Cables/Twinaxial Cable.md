# Twinaxial Cable

These are like [[Coaxial Cables]] but instead of one inner conductor, there are two.

These are common in [[Ethernet Standard|10 gigabit]] ethernet [[Transceivers#Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP+)|SFP+]] cables, these cables provide:

- full duplex
- up to 5 meters
- low cost
- low latency compared to [[Digital Cables#Twisted Pair Cables|twisted pair cables]].
