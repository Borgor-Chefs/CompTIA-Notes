# Cables

This folder is about cables: their connectors and their transfer mediums. A cable is made up of two parts:

- the connector which plugs into a device
- the medium inside the cable that acts as a transfer medium between the two connectors

There are:

- [[Digital Cables|digital cables]] which transmit serial data
- [[Coaxial Cables|coaxial cables]] which transmit analog data
- [[Fiber Optic Cables|fiber optic cables]] which transmit photons as information

There is also:

- the [[Wiring Standards|cable standard]] which dictates how digital cables are supposed to be wired
- [[Cable Categories|cable categories]] which dictate their speed
