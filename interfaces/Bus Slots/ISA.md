This is a really old piece of technology designed in 1981 as the new standard for the computer hardware industry. This is a 16-bit [[!Bus Slots|bus slot]] and had a 8-bit variation for backwards compatibility with even older hardware.

This bus slot was superseded by [[PCIe|PCI]] and by [LPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Pin_Count).
