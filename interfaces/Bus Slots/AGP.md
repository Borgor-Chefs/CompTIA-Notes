# Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)

Created to assist in accelerating 3D graphics and is faster than the [[#Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)|PCI]] slot because it has its own dedicated pathway to the processor (via. the [[The Motherboard#North Bridge|north bridge]]). This slot is only used for a [[Graphics Card|video card]].

This slot is usually colored brown.

>This but slot was superseded by [[PCIe#PCI Express (PCIe)|PCIe x16]].
