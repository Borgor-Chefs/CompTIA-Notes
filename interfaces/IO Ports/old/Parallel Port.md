This uses a D-sub connector known as the DB-25 connector.

The parallel port is mainly used for connecting printers. This sends multiple streams of data over different connectors simultaneously.

For consumers, this port has been replaced by the [[USB|USB]] port for connections to printers, other devices and mainly speeds.

## Current Use

>Read about the current uses on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_port#Current_use).

However, manufacturers apparently still use this for certain machines or devices that are still in use (and that are still running).
