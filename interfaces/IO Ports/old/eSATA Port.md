>The above is an instance of eSATAp and [[USB]] port. Quite the combination.

The external [[HDD#Serial ATA (SATA)|SATA]] port (eSATA) which is used for attaching external SATA drives and can be used with [[USB]] connectors. This also functions similarly to [[USB|USB]] and [[Firewire|Firewire]] ports.

Transfer speeds are faster but it requires its own power plug. Another port called the eSATAp port combines data transfer and power in, all in one port.
