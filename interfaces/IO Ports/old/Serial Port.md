# Serial Port

The serial port is an older technology which was mainly used for terminals and modems. Like the name, this port transmits data in serial.

If a device has a serial port, it means that the device is (usually) RS-232 compliant, or RS-485 or RS-422 compliant. The most common adaptor you will see is a D-type adaptor (not the picture shown, but the picture shown in [[Parallel Port]]).

For consumers, this port has been replaced primarily with the [[USB]] port.

## Current Use

According to Wikipedia, this is actually still in use, mainly in:

- industrial automation systems
- scientific instruments
- point of sale machines
- and some industrial and consumer products

It is used because it provides a low-speed, simple connection to a device.

>I thought this port would have become defunct like a lot of other ports, but apparently not.
