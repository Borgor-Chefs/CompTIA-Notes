The PS/2 port is a 6 pin - multi-din connector. An older technology which is being phased out for USB technology.

These ports have coloring where;

- Green is for a mouse
- Purple is for a keyboard

>See the above import.

There are variations of this port where the individual keyboard and mouse ports are merged into one. One half being green and the other being purple.

>This port isn't fully phased out. There are keyboard enthusiasts and companies who use and produce keyboards that have these connectors.
