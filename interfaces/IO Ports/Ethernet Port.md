# Ethernet Port

>To read about the ethernet technology, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet).

An "ethernet port" is, in actuality, an [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45) (Ethernet Cable)|RJ-45]] connector that is used to send data to another device (either another computer or a [[Networking Hardware#Routers|router]]).

The goal of this port is to provide a constant connection to a network.
