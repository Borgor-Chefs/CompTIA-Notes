The firewire port (or the IEEE port) is commonly used to attach cameras or printers. This type of port isn't nearly as common as the [[USB|USB]] port and a lot of [[The Motherboard|motherboards]] will not have this type of port.

You can recognize this port by its D shape. Firewire has transfer speeds up to 400 Mb/s (less than USB 2.0). This is found on many type of video and multimedia devices.

This is apparently (according to Wikipedia) still used today, although it has been superseded by [[Thunderbolt]] and [[USB|USB 3.0]].
