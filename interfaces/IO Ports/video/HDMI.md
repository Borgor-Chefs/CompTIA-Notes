Designed in 2002, this port superseded the [[DVI|DVI]] and [[VGA|VGA]] ports.

HDMI is a proprietary audio/video interface that transmits uncompressed video and either compressed or uncompressed audio data from an HDMI compliant source to an HDMI compliant output such as a display controller or to a compatible monitor, video projector, TV or digital audio device.

HDMI is the digital replacement for analog video standards. HDMI has 19 pins and a bitrate of 48 Gbit/s (as of HDMI 2.1a).

HDMI became the de facto standard for HDTVs and is one of the most common ports you will encounter.
