Developed in 1999, this type of port was designed by the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG) and is used to connect a video output device such as a video display controller or to a display device such as a computer monitor.

This interface was designed to transmit uncompressed digital video and comes in difference variations;

- DVI-A for analog data only
- DIV-D for digital data only
- DVI-I for digital and analog data

This port was superseded by the [[#^fd6bbc|HDMI]] and [[#^95fc90|DisplayPort]] ports.
