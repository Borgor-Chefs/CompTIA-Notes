Designed in 2006, this port also superseded the [[DVI|DVI]] and [[VGA|VGA]] ports. This technology relies on "packetized data transmission" which is similar to how [[Ethernet Port|ethernet]], [[USB|USB]] and [[PCIe|PCIe]] function.

DisplayPort can carry video, audio, USB and other forms of data. It can transmit audio and video simultaneously although both can be transmitted without the other.

This port is also backwards compatible with interfaces such as [[#^6370bf|DVI]] or [[#^fd6bbc|HDMI]] via. either active or passive adapters.
