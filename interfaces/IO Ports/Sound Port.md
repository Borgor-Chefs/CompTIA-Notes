# Sound Port

Sound ports are for audio devices such as headphones, microphones or a speaker. The [[Sound Card|sound card]] processes audio and transmits it through a computer's speakers.

If a [[The Motherboard|motherboard]] has these ports present, it means that it has a sound card built in. This is known as integrated sound.

A basic [[Sound Card|sound card]] will have a green port for speakers and a pink one for a microphone, however more sophisticated sound cards will have more ports for subwoofers, etc.
