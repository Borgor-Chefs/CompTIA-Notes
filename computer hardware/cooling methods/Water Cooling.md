# Water Cooling

A newer type of cooling which uses water instead of air. The unit it made of three major components:

- the radiator
- the pump
- the hosing

The pump component mounts onto the CPU and the radiator is meant to be exposed to the outside air for air intake.

Cooling is accomplished by the intake fan built into the radiator which cools the water making contact with the CPU via. the pump components.

The advantages of water coolling is that it is far better at cooling than air and is far quieter than a massive array of fans. The drawback is that they are more expensive.
