There are many sizes in which a motherboard can come in and this is called the [[The Motherboard|motherboard]] form factor. The most common being the ATX form factor.

The most common motherboard form factors are;

- [[#^7b568f|AT]]
- [[#^9cf3cf|ATX]]
	- [[#^e74b82|Micro ATX]]
- [[#^34989d|BTX]]
- [[#^544523|ITX]]
- [[#^2f86d3|NLX]]

## Advanced Technology (AT)

^7b568f

Created in 1980s by IBM and was superceded by the ATX form factor. It measures at 12 inches by 13.8 inches.

## Advanced Technology eXtension (ATX)

^9cf3cf

Created in 1995 by Intel and is the standard form factor for PCs today. It measures at 12 inches by 9.6 inches.

### Micro ATX

^e74b82

Micro ATX is designed for smaller computer cases. They also have fewer features and consume less power than an ATX motherboard. It measures at 9.6 inches by 9.6 inches

## BTX

^34989d

BTX is meant to be the successor to the ATX motherboard and was designed by Intel. Sporting improvements such as:

- improved air flow design
- flexible design which works in large and smaller cases

This motherboard takes advantage of newer technologies such as:

- [[IO Interfaces#^1d9a68|USB 2.0]]
- [[Bus Slots#^93c132|PCIe]]
- [[HDD#^20a48d|SATA]]

## ITX

^544523

ITX is designed for smaller, space saving computers. Created by VIA Technologies. They consume less power and are often only cooled by heat sinks (no fans).

There are four models of ITX;

- Mini ITX
	- created in 2001
	- used for space saving computers
- Nano ITX
	- created in 2005
	- designed to be used in digital recorders, media centers and cars
- Pico ITX
	- created in 2007
- Mobile ITX
	- created in 2009
	- 6cm by 6cm

## NLX

^2f86d3

Created Intel, designed for low-end / low profile computers. Utilizes a riser card which has slots to plug in extra components in parallel. Typically found in slim line computer cases.
