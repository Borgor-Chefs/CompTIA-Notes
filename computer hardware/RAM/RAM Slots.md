# Random Access Memory (RAM) Slots

[[RAM|RAM]] sticks (circuit boards / pieces) are installed on the [[The Motherboard|motherboard]] in specific RAM slots and sometimes in specific configurations.

Most motherboards have between 2 and 4 [[RAM|RAM]] slots.

The terms 32-bit and 64-bit data path refer to the amount of bits which are transferred in a single clock cycle. The more bits transferred, the faster the speed of the [[RAM|RAM]].

There are types of [[RAM|RAM]] slots which use specific types of RAM sticks.

- [[#Single Inline Memory Module (SIMM)]]
- [[#Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)]]
- [[#Rambus Inline Memory Module (RIMM)]]
- [[#Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module (SODIMM)]]

## Single Inline Memory Module (SIMM)

An older technology replaced by the faster [[#Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)|DIMM]] module.

SIMMs have redundant pins on both sides of the stick. SIMMs have a 32-bit data path.

## Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)

The most common type of [[RAM|RAM]] slots are DIMM slots.

A DIMM can have 168, 184 or 240 pins. Each DIMM has 2 independent rows of pins, one for each side.

DIMMs have a 64-bit data path.

## Rambus Inline Memory Module (RIMM)

This was a type of [[RAM|RAM]] technology developed by Rambus Inc.

This type of [[RAM|RAM]] has 184 pins and resembles a [[#Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)|DIMM]]. However the notches of the RIMM are in the middle of the stick.

RIMMs never fully caught on because of the advancement in [[#Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)|DIMM]] technology.

## Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module (SODIMM)

This is a type of [[RAM|RAM]] that is used in smaller devices such as laptops. These are half the size of [[#Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)|DIMMs]]. These also come in different types such as [[RAM#DDR/DDR1 (Double Data Rate)|DDR]], [[RAM#DDR2|DDR2]] and [[RAM#DDR3|DDR3]]. It is also important to note that these types are **not** compatible with each other.
