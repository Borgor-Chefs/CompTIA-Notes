# The Heat Sink

The [[CPU|CPU]] produces the most amount of heat, if the CPU were to run by itself without cooling it would likely fry itself within 10 seconds.

To remedy this a heat sink will dissipate heat. A heat sink is a block of aluminum that sits atop a CPU and whose goal is to increase the surface area of the CPU which makes contact will cool air.

The larger the heat sink, the larger the surface area, the better the cooling. Since the emitted heat will travel up into the fins of the heat sink which are being cooled off constantly.

## Thermal Compound

In order to maximize the heat transfer between the CPU and heat sink must be as close together as possible. But, because of the innate imperfections on the flat surfaces of the CPU and heat sink, this cannot be ensured.

So the solution is to use thermal compound to fill in the gaps between the two.
