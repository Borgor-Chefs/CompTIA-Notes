# The CPU Socket

^595892

The processor socket is the place on the [[The Motherboard|motherboard]] where the [[CPU|CPU]] is placed. It is a square plastic or metal holder with multiple holes which are meant for the pins of the CPU. This allows for the physical & electrical contact between the motherboard and the CPU.

## Socket Packages

A socket "package" describes how the [[CPU|CPU]] and socket touch. The modern design as to how you insert the CPU is called "zero insertion force" (ZIF). Where the CPU is installed with no force (typically you just place it in in the correct manner).

There are two main packages in the modern era and they are;

- [[#^6daf13|Pin Grid Array]] (PGA) which is used by [[#^0556b8|AMD]]
- [[#^bf23ce|Land Grid Array]] (LGA) which is used by [[#^d215df|Intel]]

### Pin Grid Array (PGA)

^6daf13

A PGA is a typical square ZIF [[#^595892|socket]] design with holes and a lock down lever.

This package has holes in the socket meant for the pins on a CPU.

### Land Grid Array (LGA)

^bf23ce

The modern ZIF design for [[#^595892|socket]] design packages. This is a socket with a cover and a lever which covers the [[CPU|CPU]] with the cover. 

The socket itself has pins where the [[CPU|CPU]] does not instead, the CPU has pads which rest on the pins of the socket, making contact.

## Socket Types

There are multiple socket types that can be categorized by their packages / companies.

- [[#^d215df|Intel]] (LGA Package)
- [[#^0556b8|AMD]] (PGA Package)

### Intel Sockets

^d215df

These are the socket types designed by [[#^d215df|Intel]]. They are sorted by the increasing amount of pins present within the socket.

#### LGA 775 a.k.a. Socket T

^66c202

![[Pasted image 20220824223229.png]]

Released in 2004, this socket type has 775 pins and was meant to succeed socket 478. This socket type was designed for [[#^d215df|Intel]] Pentium 4 and Intel Pentium dual core processors.

#### LGA 1150 a.k.a. Socket H3

![[Pasted image 20220824224025.png]]

Released in 2013, this socket type has 1150 pins and is the successor to the [[#^ce731c|LGA 1155]]. This socket supports Haswell and Broadwell based microprocessors.

#### LGA 1155 a.k.a. Socket H2

^ce731c

![[Pasted image 20220824223833.png]]

Released in 2011, this socket type has 1155 pins and was meant to replace the [[#^d56d9d|LGA 1156]]. This socket type was designed for [[#^d215df|Intel]] [[CPU|CPUs]] that use the Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge architecture.

Note that the [[CPU|CPUs]] that are made for the LGA 1155 socket and [[#^d56d9d|LGA 1156]] socket are not compatible with each other due to their physical differences.

#### LGA 1156 a.k.a. Socket H/H1

^d56d9d

![[Pasted image 20220824223521.png]]

Released in 2009, this socket type has 1156 pins. This socket type was designed for the [[#^d215df|Intel]] Core i3 and i5 processors.

#### LGA 1366 a.k.a. Socket B

^3164e1

![[Pasted image 20220824223355.png]]

Released in 2008, this socket type has 1366 pins and was meant to succeed socket [[#^66c202|LGA 775]]. This socket type was designed for the [[#^d215df|Intel]] Core i7 and Xeon processors.

#### LGA 2011 a.k.a. Socket R

![[Pasted image 20220824224327.png]]

Released in 2011, this socket type has 2011 pins and has succeeded the [[#^3164e1|LGA 1366]]. This socket was designed for high-performance [[CPU|CPUs]] that are based on the [[#^d215df|Intel]] Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge architectures.

### AMD Sockets

^0556b8

These are the socket types designed by [[#^0556b8|AMD]]. They are sorted by the increasing amount of pins present within the socket.

#### FM1

![[Pasted image 20220826152021.png]]

Released in 2011, this socket type has 905 pins. This socket was designed for [[#^0556b8|AMD]] accelerated processing units (APU). An APU is designed to act as a [[CPU|CPU]] and a graphics accelerator in one chip.

#### FM2

^20c6b1

![[Pasted image 20220826152240.png]]

Released in 2012, this socket type has 904 pins.

#### FM2+

![[Pasted image 20220826152250.png]]

Released in 2014, this socket type has 906 pins. This is a new revision of the [[#^20c6b1|FM2]] socket.

#### AM3

^09c98c

![[Pasted image 20220826151652.png]]

Released in 2009, this socket type has 941 pins and has succeeded the AM2+ socket.

#### AM3+

![[Pasted image 20220826151827.png]]

Released in 2011, this socket type has 942 pins and is a modification and the successor to the [[#^09c98c|AM3]] socket. This socket type retains compatibility with [[CPU|CPUs]] designed for AM3 sockets.
