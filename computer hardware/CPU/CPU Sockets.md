# The CPU Socket

The processor socket is the place on the [[The Motherboard|motherboard]] where the [[CPU|CPU]] is placed. It is a square plastic or metal holder with multiple holes which are meant for the pins of the CPU. This allows for the physical & electrical contact between the motherboard and the CPU.

>Intel and AMD make their own sockets which are not mutually compatible.

## Socket Packages

A socket "package" describes how the [[CPU|CPU]] and socket touch.

The modern design as to how you insert the CPU is called "zero insertion force" (ZIF). Where the CPU is installed with no force (typically you just place it in in the correct manner).

There are two main packages in the modern era and they are;

- [[#Pin Grid Array (PGA)]] which is used by [[AMD CPU Socket Types|AMD]]
- [[#Land Grid Array (LGA)]] which is used by [[Intel CPU Socket Types|Intel]]

### Pin Grid Array (PGA)

A PGA is a typical square ZIF socket design with holes and a lock down lever.

This package has holes in the socket meant for the pins on a CPU.

### Land Grid Array (LGA)

The modern ZIF design for socket design packages. This is a socket with a cover and a lever which covers the [[CPU|CPU]] with the cover. 

The socket itself has pins where the [[CPU|CPU]] does not instead, the CPU has pads which rest on the pins of the socket, making contact.
