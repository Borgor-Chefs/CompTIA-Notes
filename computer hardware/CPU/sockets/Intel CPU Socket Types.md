# Intel Sockets Types

Intel-made CPU sockets use the [[CPU Sockets#Land Grid Array (LGA)|LGA]] package. Here are the notable Intel-made sockets:

|Socket Name|Pins|Release Date|Successor?|
|-|-|-|-|
|[[#LGA 775 (Socket T)]]|775|2004| |
|[[#LGA 1150 (Socket H3)]]|1150|2013|Socket H2|
|[[#LGA 1155 (Socket H2)]]|1155|2011|Socket H/H1|
|[[#LGA 1156 (Socket H/H1)]]|1156|2009| |
|[[#LGA 1366 (Socket B)]]|1366|2008|LGA 775|
|[[#LGA 2011 (Socket R)]]|2011|2011|LGA 1336|

## Sockets

### LGA 775 (Socket T)

![[Pasted image 20220824223229.png]]

Released in 2004, this socket type has 775 pins and was meant to succeed socket 478. This socket type was designed for Intel Pentium 4 and Intel Pentium dual core processors.

### LGA 1150 (Socket H3)

Released in 2013, this socket type has 1150 pins and is the successor to the [[#LGA 1155 (Socket H2)|LGA 1155]]. This socket supports Haswell and Broadwell based microprocessors.

### LGA 1155 (Socket H2)

Released in 2011, this socket type has 1155 pins and was meant to replace the [[#LGA 1156 (Socket H/H1)|LGA 1156]]. This socket type was designed for Intel [[CPU|CPUs]] that use the Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge architecture.

Note that the [[CPU|CPUs]] that are made for the LGA 1155 socket and [[#LGA 1156 (Socket H/H1)|LGA 1156]] socket are not compatible with each other due to their physical differences.

### LGA 1156 (Socket H/H1)

![[Pasted image 20220824223521.png]]

Released in 2009, this socket type has 1156 pins. This socket type was designed for the Intel Core i3 and i5 processors.

### LGA 1366 (Socket B)

![[Pasted image 20220824223355.png]]

Released in 2008, this socket type has 1366 pins and was meant to succeed socket [[#LGA 775 (Socket T)|LGA 775]]. This socket type was designed for the Intel Core i7 and Xeon processors.

### LGA 2011 (Socket R)

![[Pasted image 20220824224327.png]]

Released in 2011, this socket type has 2011 pins and has succeeded the [[#LGA 1366 (Socket B)|LGA 1366]]. This socket was designed for high-performance [[CPU|CPUs]] that are based on the Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge architectures.
