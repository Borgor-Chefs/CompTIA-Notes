# AMD Socket Types

AMD-made CPU sockets use the [[CPU Sockets#Pin Grid Array (PGA)|PGA]] package. Here are the notable AMD-made sockets:

|Socket Name|Pins|Release Date|Successor?|
|-|-|-|-|
|[[#FM1]]|905|2011| |
|[[#FM2]]|904|2012| |
|[[#FM2+]]|906|2014|FM2|
|[[#AM3]]|941|2009|AM2+|
|[[#AM3+]]|942|2011|AM3|
