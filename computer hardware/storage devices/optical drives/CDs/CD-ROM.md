# The CD-ROM

CD-ROM stands for "Compact Disk, Read-Only Memory" and it is as it sounds, the storage medium is a disk.

CD-ROMs have become a standard component in most computers today since a lot of things whether it's installation mediums, movies, songs or games are stored on disks.

Now CD-ROMs as the name implies are read-only, they cannot be changed once the CD has data on it.

A CD can hold upto 700 MB of data.
