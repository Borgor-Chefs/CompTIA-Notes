# The DVD-ROM Drive

The DVD-ROM Drive stands for "Digital Video Disk, Read-Only Memory"

This is a type of device that can read DVD disks. These have largely replaced CD-ROM drives.

One of the reasons for this is because DVDs can store up to 4.7 GB worth of data.

DVD-ROM drives can read CD-ROM drives as well.
