# Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

The HDD is a form of permanent storage or non-volatile storage. How this technology works is that there are magnetic disks on the inside stacked on top of each other. There is a read and write arm which hovers on top of each disk.

The read and write speed of the disk is relative to how fast the platters spin within the drive itself.

## Types of HDD 

### Parallel ATA (PATA or EIDE)

This type of hard drive uses a 40-pin ribbon cable as its connector, a PATA cable can support two HDD drives per cable.

The drive at the end of the cable is known as the 'master' drive whilst the other (on the middle connector) is known as the 'slave' drive.

The latest standard is ATA133.

### Serial ATA (SATA)

The newest standard hard drive, SATA which is faster than PATA (with transfer speeds up to 6Gb/s). Data travels in a serial path (one bit after the other). The major advantage over PATA is that SATA drives are hot swappable.

SATA drives also used smaller cables.

## Common Failures

- Since the disks rely on magnetism to function they can fail if the disks become demagnetized.
- The read-write arm could fail on all the disks or a singular disk making the data become unreadable.
- Dropping the drive could physically damage a disk on the inside, corrupting the data on the disk.
