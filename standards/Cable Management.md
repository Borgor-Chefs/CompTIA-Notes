# Cable Management

In an office setting, it's good practice to use a [[Patch Panel]] to aggregate all the connections from cubicles into one place, then taking those connections and routing them somewhere else.

>Sometimes the patch panel might have a [[Punch Down Interface|punch down interface]] and a [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45)|RJ-45]] interface on the other side, two [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45)|RJ-45]] interfaces or two [[Punch Down Interface|punch down interfaces]].
