>The above is an [[SSD]] with the M.2 form factor.

M.2 is a standard, not a form factor like [[PCIe]]. It is a type of [[SSD]] that may or may not have [[NVMe]] support.

It is designed to be inserted into [[PCIe#miniPCIe|miniPCIe]] bus slots or its own designated M.2 slot. This standard was created back in 2013 and is designed to replace the mSATA standard.

M.2 provides connections between bus slots and components, such connections are:

- [[PCIe|PCIe x4]]
- SATA 3.0
- [[USB#Speeds|USB 3.0]] (M.2 is the physical connection from this port to the motherboard)

The M.2 standard is backwards compatible with older technologies and was declared to be the standard format for storage devices as of August 2013.

## Sizes
