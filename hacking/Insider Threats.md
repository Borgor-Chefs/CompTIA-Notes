# Insider Threats

This is essentially where either; an employee(s) or an attacker is actively collecting information about your infrastructure from the inside.

It's been known that attackers will bribe employees to map out the network and physical locations of devices. Things like:

- where are the keys located
- where are the guards located
- what are the guards' schedule

In terms of software and hardware, it could be:

- what devices have access to storage servers
- what subnets are the routers on
- etc

It's all about casing the company itself from a computer system point of view.

Sometimes, employees will be bribed with some form of cryptocurrency. What can happen, is that the attackers will give a bribed employee ransomware to infect the network with.

## Mitigation

First off, your employees shouldn't be accepting bribes and should be paid well enough to facilitate this. But, you can:

- practice proper security practices such as [[Best Security Practices#Least Privilege|least privilege]]
- always have backups of your data
- keep your software up to date
