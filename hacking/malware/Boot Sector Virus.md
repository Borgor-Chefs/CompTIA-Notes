# Boot Sector Virus

This is a type of virus that lives in the boot sector, hence the name.

An anti-virus won't be able to help you here since this virus started with the operating system itself and not after like most other viruses. The boot loader was modified and is now running malware.

## Why Don't We See Boot Sector Viruses Anymore?

>They still exist, but are far fewer in number.

Same as [[Rootkit|rootkits]], because of the [[The BIOS|UEFI BIOS]] and Secure Boot, it prevents this type of malware from running during the boot process.
