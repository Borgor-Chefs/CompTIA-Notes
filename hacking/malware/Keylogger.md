# Keyloggers

Keyloggers do what the name implies, log your key strokes. Keyloggers can:

- record your key strokes
- take screenshots
- check where you're clicking

>The smartest keyloggers will usually lay dormant until you access websites like banks, email or other websites. Sometimes they will awake when an admin access panel appears.

This collected information will get sent to an attacker.

Keep in mind, this circumvents encryption. It doesn't matter if you're using HTTPS to use your email, the key logger will have already captured your password as you typed it in.
