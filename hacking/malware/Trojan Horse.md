# Trojan Horse

This term comes from when the ancient Greeks gave the Trojans a giant wooden horse as a gift, but was actually full of Greek soldiers.

In the computer world, this is something that masks itself as legitimate program but in actuality is something malicious.

A trojan horse is typically used as a gateway for an attacker to install other malware onto your computer.

The better trojan horses are designed to circumvent and or disable your anti-virus.
