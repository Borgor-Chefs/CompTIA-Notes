# Cryptominers

This type of malware is designed to mine cryptocurrencies, usually Bitcoin. Long story short, some cryptos use a "proof of work" scheme where computers have to guess a number to complete a hash. The more computers guessing, the more likely you are of guessing the correct number and gaining some crypto.

Since hackers like to work smarter and not harder (and can't afford the ASICs and power costs of mining crypto), they've taken the liberty of renting your machine (without your consent) to mine crypto for them.

A good way to tell is if you're either hovering at huge [[CPU]] usage or spiking constantly.
