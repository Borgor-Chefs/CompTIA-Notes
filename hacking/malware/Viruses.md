# Viruses

This is more of a generic type of malware that reproduces itself to spread across a computer network and across the internet. This requires human intervention to stop.

Viruses can (and might) spread to other computers, removeable drives, servers, etc.

Viruses may or may not cause problems, some are benign, some are purely for entertainment and some are both but deadly. For example, there's a virus that replaces your operating system with Nyan cat (something absolutely hilarious for about 5 minutes until you realise that you don't have a computer anymore).
