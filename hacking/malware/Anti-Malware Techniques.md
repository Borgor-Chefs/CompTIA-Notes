# Anti-Malware Techniques

Here are some anti-malware tools you can use to remove malware from your PC:

- [[Windows Recovery Environment]]
- anti-virus/anti-malware software such as MalwareBytes
- [[#Software Firewalls|a software firewall]] such as [[Windows Defender Firewall|Windows Defender]]
- [[#Anti-Phishing Training|anti-phishing training]]
- [[#OS Reinstallation|doing a fresh install of your OS]]

>You really only need Windows Defender.
>Also, if possible, choose a "real-time" anti-virus as it will monitor your programs in real-time in order to flag them as malware or not.

## Software Firewalls

This is a firewall that monitors the outbound and inbound traffic of your computer, checking for any suspicious activity such as programs trying to contact suspicious domains and such.

>A great example of this is [[Windows Defender Firewall]].

## Anti-Phishing Training

The most common method of malware getting onto a network is by people clicking on suspicious links (this happens way to often). The term for this is calling phishing, wherein an attacker will profile someone at a company and send them an email that's meant to look like an email from this person's boss with a link that will steal information or download some malware.

The counter-measure here is to train your employees not to click on suspicious links and how to recognize a phishing email.

## OS Reinstallation

A destructive but surefire method is to reinstall your operating system. This should be done as a last resort and not before anything else. This will wipe your system and you will start anew.

If you can backup any files, do so. If you have a backup, use that.

In the unfortunate circumstance where you have no backups, cry.
