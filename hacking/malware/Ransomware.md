# Ransomware

This is an especially nasty piece of malware. This type of malware will encrypt your files and usually demand a ransom of some sort, usually bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.

Your operating system will remain intact, but your files, pictures, documents and other precious files will be encrypted and unusable until you obtain the decryption key from the attackers.

>Fun fact, since a lot of ransomware is developed in Russia, hacking groups usually remain untargeted by the Russian government unless they attack native Russian systems. This being said, if you have a Russian keyboard installed, ransomware of this origin will (hopefully) not attack you. But instead, delete itself from the computer and or do nothing.

A way to counteract this malware is by deleting everything, performing a fresh install and using a backup of your files.
