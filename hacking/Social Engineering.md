# Social Engineering

This is a form of attack where an attacker will try to gain your trust so that you will give them some personal information that they can use to try and steal something from you such as money or credentials or to get you to download malware or viruses onto your computer.

## Phishing

One of the most common types of social engineering is phishing, where an attacker will lie and or pretend to be from a trusted organization to scrape credentials from you.

Usually, they will send you a link to a website that's similar to the proper one but different. Also, the website will usually be somewhat incorrect or "fishy" as details will be missing or wrong.

Sometimes, these attackers will call you over the phone (a.k.a. Vishing) where the attacker is spoofing the caller ID to be from America, when they're actually located in Kolkata, India.

>See [[Anti-Malware Techniques#Anti-Phishing Training|here]] for ways to prevent phishing from occurring.

### Spear Phishing

This is a directed form of phishing, wherein the attacker is personalizing their emails or connections with personal information.

For example, an attacker who has profiled their target correctly, might send an email to their victim saying that a meeting was postponed with a link in the email, knowing that their victim has a meeting in about 15 to 30 minutes.

Or, an attacker could send an email to the CEO of a company (a.k.a. whaling) from a direct subordinate with a macro-enabled excel spreadsheet about accounting information of the current quarter.

### Impersonation

This is similar to phishing but in real-life e.g., someone is physically coming up to your desk and impersonating someone from another team.

## Shoulder Surfing

This is literally where someone is looking at what you're doing on your computer from either close or far away using binoculars.

A good way to prevent this is to purchase a privacy filter. This is a piece of plastic that goes over your [[LCD Display|LCD display]] and is made such that you can only make out details when you're looking at it head-on and not from any other angle.

## Tailgating & Piggybacking

This is where an unauthorized person tries to gain access to a building or location using social engineering. Something like, "hey can you open the door for me?" and the attacker is holding something heavy or many things. The attacker here is trying to take advantage of the generosity of people.

Essentially, the attacker is trying to use someone who is authorized to open [[Door Locks|doors]] for them.

A good way to mediate against this is by having [[Access Control Vestibules]] that will **only** allow one person at a time through the door.

## Dumpster Diving

This is literally where an attacker will go through a dumpster to try and find useful information. Things such as:

- old computers
- names
- phone numbers
- roles of people
- contact information
- old keys

Companies might dispose of their trash or valuable information on a timely basis i.e., say monthly or quarterly period. The attackers might then come and take your trash away before the actual garbage company comes.

## Wireless Evil Twins

This is where an attacker will "clone" all the information from a legitimate corporate access point and create a fake one that impersonates the original. Same [[SOHO Router Configuration#Service Set Identifier (SSID)|SSID]] and everything.

Sometimes, the attacker might use an access point that transmits with more power than the original in order for people to connect to it.
