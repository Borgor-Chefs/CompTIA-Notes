# Zero-Day Attacks

These are attacks that exploit an unknown or new vulnerability in a product or service that the manufacturer/developers aren't aware of.

Zero-days are found either by security researchers or by hackers (hopefully the former), the hackers will usually sit on these vulnerabilities and plan their next attack based on it. Security researchers are usually in it for the money and will disclose these bugs to the developers for cash or money.

>A good example of this is the Log4j exploit that happened in December 9th, 2021.
