# Common Issues

## Touchscreen is non-responsive

To fix this, try the following:

- Try restarting the phone
- Eject and reinsert the SIM card
- May have to do a hard reset of the phone
- May also be a hardware issue, but you should always try the easiest solutions first

## Apps Not Loading or Slow Performance

The cause of this is usually that the phone has too many apps open at the same time, eating up resources.

To fix this, try the following:

- Close all of the apps
- Restart the phone

Some apps require GPS to function, the app will usually tell you if it requires GPS or not. Sometimes it doesn't, this can be an easy fix.
