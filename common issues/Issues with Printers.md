# Common Issues

For the types of printers, see [[Types of Printers|here]].

## Generic

### Paper Jams

This is when a page gets stuck inside of the printer. This is usually caused by debris being stuck inside of the printer or when the pick-up rollers have failed.

This usually happens on older printers.

The solution here is to open up the printer and check for debris or to inspect the pick-up rollers and see if they have failed.

### Nothing Happens When You Print

This is most likely a connectivity issue between your computer and the printer. These are extremely common, especially with network printers.

Be sure to check the obvious issues:

- is it turned on?
- are there errors on the LCD display?
- if it's wired, is the cable actually plugged in?

If these all fail then come the more advanced issues such as checking if the printer has an IP address.

## Inkjet Printers

### Fixing Printer Streaks

If your [[Types of Printers#^a0c9d9|inkjet]] printer is streaking it is a sign that there could be an issue with the ink cartridges with an inkjet printer.

There should be tools provided by the manufacturer for fixing this issue to clean the print head.

If there are very large streaks, this could be a sign that you might have to remove the print head and ink cartridges then manually clean the print head with a lint-free cloth.

### Faded Image or Blank Image

This could either be:

- a problem with the ink cartridges
- or you're low on ink

### Colors Not Mixing

This is a sign of either a faulty ink cartridge or that the ink cartridge is low or completely out of color ink.

## Laser Printers

### Ghosting

This occurs when printing something and you can see parts of the previous print on this new page.

This usually caused by either the drum or the fuser. The drum of a laser printer has a lifespan after so many prints.

If you replace the drum of the printer and the issue still persists, then the fuser is most likely bad and needs to be replaced.
