# Common Issues

## Blank Screen

When powering up the laptop, you may hear the fans turn on and spin and the LEDs light up too but there is no image on the screen. This is called a "no display" issue.

If you experience this, the following may help;

- plugging in an external monitor, if the monitor displays an image. This most likely means that the LCD display in the laptop is bad and needs to be replaced

## Dim Display

This is caused by a bad inverter.

An inverter is a small circuit board that supplies power to the LCD monitor. It converts DC current to AC current.

The inverter is usually mounted in the display panel right below the LCD monitor.

## Battery Not Charging

This is caused by either a defective motherboard or a defective battery and either one will need to be replaced.

Another issue is that the battery discharges very fast, e.g., after a full charge the battery will die in 10 minutes. This is a common issue with older laptops.

The reason this happens is that batteries lose charging capacity overtime, typically over the course of years. When this happens the battery will need to be replaced.

## Nothing Happens When the Laptop is Turned On

If you press the power button and nothing happens e.g., no LEDs turn on and there is a blank screen.

Make sure that the laptop is actually plugged in and charging. Once you have confirmed that the laptop should be charging and it is still broken.

This a sign that you most likely have a dead laptop and the laptop itself or the motherboard needs to be replaced.

## Flickering Monitor

A flickering monitor (e.g., when you physically move the laptop the screen flickers) is a sign of either a bad LCD screen or a bad inverter.

Either of which need to be replaced.

## Sticky Keys

Laptop keyboards are not as durable as a keyboard built for a desktop for example. If you encounter sticky keys (and Windows for sure doesn't have this enabled) you must replace the laptop keyboard itself.

Be extra careful when replacing the laptop keyboard.

## Ghost Cursor

Many customers will complain that the mouse will move whenever they type on the keyboard.

A lot of the times the customer in question, when typing will accidentally touch the touchpad. Whether that be a sleeve or they just don't feel the palm of their hand touching the touchpad.

The solution for this is to disable the tap feature in the touchpad settings.

The customer could also be serious and is not accidentally touching the touchpad, in this case it is best to download or update the drivers for the touchpad.

## Overheating

A symptom of this is that the laptop freezes or is really hot. Laptops have [[Fans|fans]] to cool it off. These fans are usually located on the sides or on the bottom of the laptop.

The laptop's fans may or may not be:

- dead
- blocked by dust
- the laptop may not be used on a hard, flat surface
	- this hinders air circulation

First see if the laptop's fans are active first and if they're dirty, clean them. Finally, recommend to the customer to make sure that the fans are exposed to the air.

## Intermittent Wireless Issue

This could be that;

- you're out of range
- there is interference (something physical is blocking the signal to the laptop)
- drivers need to be updated
	- this commonly occurs when a laptop has updated the OS
