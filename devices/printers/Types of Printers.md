## Non-Impact Printers

### Inkjet Printer

The most common type of printer for home use. This works by the print head moving back and forth across the paper placing very tiny dots (which are smaller in diameter than a human hair) on the paper.

They typically come with two type of ink cartridges;

- one for color
- one for black

This type of printer produces photo quality results.

The main downside is that the ink may smudge, where as laser printers do not smudge.

### Laser Printer

These vary in size, from smaller personal ones to large scale company sized printers. These provide the highest quality images but they are quite expensive.

How this printer works is that a magnetic drum spins whilst a laser essentially "draws" the image onto the drum by shining itself onto the drum. After that, a fine powder known as toner is applied to the drum clinging to the magnetically charged portions of it.

After the the drum makes contact with the page applying the toner, producing a very high quality image.

### Thermal Printer

This produces images or text via. heat. There is special paper known as thermal paper which is coated in wax based ink.

The only thing the print head does is apply heat to the areas in which there should be something, this turns that said area black, producing an image.

When the ink is cooled the ink is permanent.

These are very quiet printers. They are commonly used for printing labels and barcodes.

## Impact Printers

### Dot Matrix Printer

These are an older technology which produces mediocre print quality when compared to modern printing technology.

They work by the print head striking a cloth ink ribbon which produces individual dots which form an image.

Despite their age, they can produce carbon copies of documents, are very durable and last a long time.

## Virtual Printing

This is where you "print" to a print ready file which other printers can process and print. This will save the document in an uneditable form, which you can send off to other computers to print out.

There's also the "Print to PDF" option where the document is printed to a universally readable format known as a portable document format file or PDF.

Since this so common, the majority of new devices can read and print PDF files. However some older computers or devices may have to have new software installed in order to read and print PDFs.
