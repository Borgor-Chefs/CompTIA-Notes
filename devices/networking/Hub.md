![[Pasted image 20230322194855.png]]

These are "dumb" devices in the sense that it does not care where data is sent nor does it filter any data like a firewall, the purpose of the hub is to copy all data from one [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45) (Ethernet Cable)|ethernet]] connection over to all other active ethernet connections.

There are two types:

- passive - doens't require a power source
- active - does require a power source
