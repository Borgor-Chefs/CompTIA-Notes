This is a typical broadband cable modem, usually called DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interfacer Specifications). This supports speeds of 10 Gigabit downstream and 1 Gigabit upstream. This handles both incoming and outgoing data signals.

There are also expansion modem cards which are used to transmit and receive analog data which comes from telephone lines. The job of this card is to convert analog data to digital data. The maximum speed of most modems today is 56 Kbps.
