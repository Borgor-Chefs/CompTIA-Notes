# Media Converter

![[Pasted image 20240319164416.png]]

This is a media converter, this functions on the [[OSI Model#Physical Layer|physical layer]] of the [[OSI Model]], it converts electrical signals over a copper connection to light signals over a fiber optic connection.

This can be useful depending on the scenario, say you have only fiber connections but your switches are only copper, therefore you'll need one of these devices to translate the signals for you.
