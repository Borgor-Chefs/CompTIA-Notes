# About Networking Devices

This folder contains information about physical devices used for networking. Devices such as:

- [[Bridge]]
- [[Firewall]]
- [[Hub]]
- [[Modem]]
- [[Patch Panel]]
- [[Router]]
- [[Switch]]

Some types of network components use Power over Ethernet (PoE) to supply power to the device. Some devices do not have this feature and they will instead have an interface to receive power.
