# Patch Panels

![[Pasted image 20230322201008.png]]

This is a panel that has multiple cable connections and connects incoming and outgoing patch cables in [[Network Types#Local Area Network (LAN)|LAN]].

This is very handy for network administrators to rearrange connections at ease.

>Patch panels may have one side that is a [[Punch Down Interface]].

## Fiber Distribution Panels

These are for permanent fiber installations with a patch panel at both ends. The box contains loops at certain lengths, one thing to note is that [[Fiber Optic Cables]] can break if bent too tightly.

This also often contains a service loop, which is extra cable length for things like physically moving the fiber box or moving the connections.
