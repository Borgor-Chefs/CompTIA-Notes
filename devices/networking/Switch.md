# Switches

![[Pasted image 20230322195223.png]]

Unlike [[Hub|hubs]], switches are intelligent, they memorize the addresses of connected devices and only send data to and from different addresses based on their configuration. The goal of a switch is to reduce the amount of traffic on a network.

Switches operate on level 2 of the [[OSI Model|OSI model]] and they filter ethernet packets based on the MAC addresses contained within the packet.
