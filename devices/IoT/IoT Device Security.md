# IoT Device Security

>I feel confident in saying that 90% of IoT devices are not made with security in mind and odds are can get you hacked or give the hacker a foothold in your network.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are nice since they provide functionality like sensors, smart devices, wearable technology, facility automation, etc. but are 99 times out of 100 going to get you hacked because they are usually quite insecure.

You should consider either patching them with your own software and or isolating them to their own network, away from everything else.
