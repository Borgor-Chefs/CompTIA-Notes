# Phone Remote Backup

Within the Apple ecosystem, you can backup your phone including your images, videos, documents, etc. to iCloud.

Within the Android ecosystem, I believe this is also possible using Google's cloud services or whatever phone provider you're with depending if they have the infrastructure or if they sell you the service.

Finally, I believe that local backups exist i.e., using iTunes, you can backup your phone locally to your computer. With Android, I'm not so sure.
