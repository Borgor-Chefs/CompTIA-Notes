# Phone Security

>I was today years old when I found out that phones don't automatically ship with a firewall.

## Anti-Malware

With Apple, the software environment is closed and very tightly regulated. Malware has to find a vulnerability in order to pwn your device.

With Android, you can install applications from anywhere, which is a very nice feature. But, if you're not careful, you can definitely install malware.

With both Apple and Android, applications run in a sandbox meaning that they run with a limited subset of features and capabilities that ask the operating system for elevated privileges.

You can also install third-party anti-virus software to protect your device.

## Firewalls

Since most traffic from a phone is initiated from a phone to an outside source (i.e., outbound traffic), having a firewall isn't the default since not much or very little traffic is actually initiated from outside the phone itself.

There are firewalls available (mainly on Android) but none are standard.
