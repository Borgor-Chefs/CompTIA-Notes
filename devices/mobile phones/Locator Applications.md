# Locator Applications

This is useful in the case where your device gets stolen. You can use your phone's internal GPS in order to track it's position in real time in case you lost it accidentally or if it was stolen.

>Within the Apple ecosystem, almost everything can phone home to their rightful owners. Including; Apple AirTags, Apple Airpods, etc.

From an Apple phone, you can:

- get directions to your device
- play a sound to locate it if you're near
- display a message on the screen, or
- wipe all your data

>The video only showed off an Apple iPhone, I don't know if the same capabilities are there for an Android, since I don't use one.
