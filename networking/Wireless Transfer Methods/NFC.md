# Near-field Communication

This is a method of data transfer/communication using radio waves to communicate with another NFC device.

This is a slower mode of transport and both devices have to be really close (less than 20cm) to each other in order for it to work. Speeds range from 106 to 424 kbps. NFC devices would fit under the [[Network Types#Personal Area Network (PAN)|PAN]] classification.

NFC standards are also derived from existing [[RFID|RFID]] standards including [ISO/IEC 14443](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14443) and [FeliCa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeliCa).

You'd think that this technology would be outclasses by [[Bluetooth|Bluetooth]] but this is not the case since NFC operates at much less power than Bluetooth. Most likely due to the frequency that NFC operates on (13.56 MHz).
