# WAN Termination

Essentially, this is where you connect your local traffic, say in a building, to your [[Internet Access Technologies#Internet Access Technologies|ISP]] or [[Network Types#Wide Area Network (WAN)|WAN]] connection. These are known as "demarcation points" i.e., the place you send your traffic off to the internet.

These demarcation points are used everywhere, at homes to build office buildings. This is usually a [[Network Interface Unit]] which can be as simple as plugging in a [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45)|RJ-45]] cable into it.

You will often hear the terms "customer premises equipment" or "customer prem", this means your own equipment i.e., [[Router|routers]], [[Switch|switches]], etc.
