# Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

Instead of solely using frames like in [[Data Communication|the OSI model]], packets are labelled, determining where they are sent next. Labels identify established paths between endpoints whereas [[IP Address|network addresses]] identify endpoints.

You can put any type of information inside of this packet i.e., IP packets, ethernet frames, protocols, etc.
