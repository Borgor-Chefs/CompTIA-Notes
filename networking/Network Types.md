# Network Types

These are the types of networks that are largely classified by their size and goegraphical distribution.

>See more from Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN).

Here are the most common types:

- VPN
- [[#Personal Area Network (PAN)|PAN]]
- [[#Local Area Network (LAN)|LAN]]
	- [[#Storage Area Network (SAN)|SAN]]
	- [[#Wireless LAN (WLAN)|WLAN]]
	- [[#Virtual LAN (VLAN)|VLAN]]
- [[#Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)|MAN]]
- [[#Wide Area Network (WAN)|WAN]]

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)

This is essentially an encrypted tunnel which sends and receives traffic to and from a server located (usually) in another country which then gets routed to the actual destination.

The goal of a VPN is to have this server (which functions as a relay) to make the connection to the website, resource, etc. for you. This is a method of obscuring your real IP address.

## Personal Area Network (PAN)

This is a very small network that are used to connect laptops, phones, printers, etc. together.
Generally used to transfer small files such as images, videos, audio, etc.

## Local Area Network (LAN)

A small network that consists of computers, printers, servers, etc. all physically located within the same building.

The most common type of LAN is an ethernet LAN where all devices are connected via. [[Cable Categories#Cable Categories|CAT 5 ethernet cable]] to a [[Switch|switch]].

### Storage Area Network (SAN)

This is a dedicated network comprised of only storage devices. 

>They are primarily used to access data storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries from servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as direct-attached storage.

### Wireless LAN (WLAN)

This is a regular [[#Local Area Network (LAN)|LAN]] but it is wireless and most commonly uses Wi-Fi to connect devices together.

### Virtual LAN (VLAN)

This is essentially a partioned network within a [[#Local Area Network (LAN)|LAN]] to separate traffic at the data link layer of the [[OSI Model#Data Link|OSI model]].

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

![[Pasted image 20230421163618.png]]

This larger than a [[#Local Area Network (LAN)|LAN]] network because this spans multiple buildings within the same city or town.
MANs are typically connected via. fiber optic cable or another highspeed medium.

## Wide Area Network (WAN)

![[Pasted image 20230421163518.png]]

This is a large area network which spans a large geographical area such as cities, nationwide, continent wide or globally.

A great example of this is the internet.
