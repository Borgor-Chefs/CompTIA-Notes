The RJ-11 is a 4-wire telephone jack used for connecting phones to landlines. This type of cable is also used to connect modems on computers. It locks itself in place using a hinged locking tab.

This connector resembles the [[#^459cd4|RJ-45]] connector but smaller.

## Register Jack 45 (RJ-45) (Ethernet Cable)

^459cd4

![[Pasted image 20220828203935.png]]

This is the most common networking connector, its most common use is to connect a computer to a local area network (LAN). It is used to attach [[Network Interface Card|network interface cards]] to hubs or switches.

This resembles the [[#^a4bc28|RJ-11]] but larger. It also used twisted pair cabling.

## Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC)

^2b9473

![[Pasted image 20220828204150.png]]

This type of connector uses coaxial cable to fork data. It's a common type of RF connector and is used for both analog and digital video and audio.

## F-Type

^ce3b62

![[Pasted image 20220828204317.png]]

A screw on connector used on coaxial cables. Used today primarily by cable providers to attach to cable moderms. This hand tightens by an attached nut.

## Firewire (IEEE 1394)

^fc7211

![[Pasted image 20220828204614.png]]

This type of cable is recognized by its 'D' shape and is commonly associated with attaching peripheral devices such as digital cameras and printers than network connections.

This is found on many type of video and multimedia devices.

## Universal Serial Bus

^f9657a

The USB cable is recognizeable by its signature trident logo.

![[Pasted image 20220828211010.png]]

This is the most common port you will see on any device. But there are also different types of USB connectors as shown below.

![[Pasted image 20220828204850.png]]

See [[IO Interfaces#^1d9a68|here]] for the speeds of USB technology.

### Type-A

^17845f

![[Pasted image 20220828211004.png]]

This was the initial type of USB connector, used to attach peripherals such as cameras, keyboards, etc. This is now being phased out in favor of the type-C connector.

![[Pasted image 20220828211604.png]]

There are SuperSpeed variations of this cable upon the release of USB 3.0 but have now been phased out completely.

### Type-B

^ce11c0

This type of connector was released around the same time as the type-A connector. This is now being phased out in favor of the type-C connector.

![[Pasted image 20220828211611.png]]

There are SuperSpeed variations of this cable upon the release of USB 3.0 but have now been phased out completely.

### Type-C

^e1bc87

![[Pasted image 20220828211618.png]]

Initially released in 2014 this is meant to replace the type-A and type-B connectors.

### Mini USB

^1f4b9d

![[Pasted image 20220828211535.png]]

These connectors were developed for smaller devices such as digital cameras, smartphones and tablet computers. They were initially released in April 2000 but have now been phased out around the time of USB 3.0 and in favor of the type-C connector.

### Micro USB

^6ddaca

![[Pasted image 20220828211543.png]]

These connectors were developed for even smaller devices like smartphones, PDAs and cameras. It was also meant to replace the bigger [[#^1f4b9d|mini USB]]. This connector was initially released in January 2007 but have now been phased out around the time of USB 3.2 and in favor of the type-C connector.

There were SuperSpeed variations of this cable upon the release of USB 3.0 but have now been phased out completely.

## Thunderbolt

^6e42cf

![[Pasted image 20220828205147.png]]

A newer technology released in 2011. This is a high speed interface that outputs one serial signal from a combination of [[Bus Slots#^93c132|PCIe]] and the [[IO Interfaces#^95fc90|DisplayPort]] interfaces. This was mainly used in Apple products but has now come to the PC.

![[Pasted image 20220828205201.png]]

Versions 1 & 2 uses a mini [[IO Interfaces#^95fc90|DisplayPort]] port whilst version 3 (type 3) uses the USB type-C port.

## RCA

^aa87dc

![[Pasted image 20220828205336.png]]

This is an older technology which resembles coaxial cables and you will often see these cables in groups of three. They are color coded and have the following meanings;

- White - Stereo Audio
- Red - Stereo Audio
- Yellow - Video

## Straight Tip (ST)

^624bbb

![[Pasted image 20220828205530.png]]

This is a fiber optic cable connector and uses a half-twist bayonet type of lock. Commonly used with single-mode fiber optic cable.

## Local Connector (LC)

^a7d29a

![[Pasted image 20220828205636.png]]

This is another fiber optic cable like the [[#^624bbb|ST connector]] and is similar to the [[#^459cd4|RJ-45]] style of connector. This is commonly used between floors on a building.

## Standard Connector (SC)

^6366bb

![[Pasted image 20220828205838.png]]

This is a fiber optic cable that uses a push-pull connector similar to [[#^aa87dc|audio and video plugs]]. Like the [[#^a7d29a|LC connector]] it is also used between the floors of a building.
