# Device Configuration

## SOHO Routers

SOHO stands for "Small Office / Home Office" [[Network Components#Routers|router]] and these are primarily by homes and small businesses.

To access the configuration of this router, type in the IP address of the router in your browser and login to the router.

From there you can access settings such as the [[IP Address#Private IP Address|private IP address]], [[#Service Set Identifier (SSID)|SSID]], [[DHCP|DHCP]] server, etc.

### Service Set Identifier (SSID)

This is the name of a network you can connect to via. a [[Network Components#Routers|router]].
It is shared amongst all devices in the network.

The image above is an example of how computers scan for wireless networks.

### Channel

This delves into the radio/FM communication side of things. If you are experiencing interference or picking up junk data it might be because there is another router in the near vacinity which is broadcasting on the same channel and same frequency.

To fix this, simply change the channel the router operates on (within the router's control panel).

### Security

This is where you can set what security option the router operates on, such as:

- WEP
- WPA/WPA2
- RADIUS
- nothing
