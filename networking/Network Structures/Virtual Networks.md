# Virtual Networks

The rise of virtual networks came from the idea of "why can't I just take my 100 physical servers and replace them with 1 physical server and 100 virtual ones?".

Doing this is more cost effective and can be more efficient in terms of administration and configuration.

## Network Function Virtualization (NFV)

This is the process of replacing physical network devices with virtual versions, which are managed by [[The Hypervisor]]. These virtual devices have the same functionality as a physical device i.e., [[Router|routing]], [[Switch|switching]], load balancing, [[Firewall|firewalls]], etc.

This process is quicker and easier than installing physical equipment because you can simply just click a couple buttons and then boom, new network.

## Virtual Networking Equipment

Basically, all of the physical networking equipment have a virtual counterpart which have the same functionality as the physical.

And, from what I can tell, everything functions as it would in the real world, just, virtual.
