# NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Ouput System)

This allows for applications on separate computers to communicate over a LAN. NetBIOS is more of an API rather than a protocol therefore it is not a networking protocol.

This protocol typically runs over [[TCP]] in modern networks.

From wikipedia:

>Simply saying, it is a protocol that allows communication of files and printers through the Session Layer of the OSI Model in a LAN.
