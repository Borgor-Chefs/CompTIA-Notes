# DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

This is used to assign IP addresses to computers along with manage them. This is essentially a broker for IP addresses for computers that dynamically obtain their IP.

If a DHCP server disappears from the network and the computer's IP expires and it asks for a new one, it will fail and this computer will be unable to communicate on the network until the DHCP server is back online or you manually set its IP.

If you add a second DHCP server to the network it must be configured properly else it could assign a computer the same IP address as another computer, screwing up the network. You must configure the address pool correctly.
