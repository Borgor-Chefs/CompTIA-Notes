# LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

This is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network.

From wikipedia:

>A directory service (or name service) maps the names of network resources to their respective network addresses. It is a shared information infrastructure for locating, managing, administering and organizing everyday items and network resources, which can include volumes, folders, files, printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers and other objects.
