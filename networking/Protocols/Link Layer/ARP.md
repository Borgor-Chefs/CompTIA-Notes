# Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

Simply, a computer will broadcast to a network asking for who is IP 192.168.X.X and the computer who uses said IP address will reply with their MAC address.

>Note that in this protocol, there is ZERO security going on here. No mutual authentication nor verification, etc.
