# Fiber Optic Cable

These are cables that use fiber-optic wires inside to transmit photons by means of pulses instead of electrons.

## Connectors

### Straight Tip (ST)

This is a fiber optic cable connector and uses a half-twist bayonet type of lock. Commonly used with single-mode fiber optic cable.

### Local/Lucent Connector (LC)

This is another fiber optic cable like the [[#Straight Tip (ST)|ST connector]] and is similar to the [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45) (Ethernet Cable)|RJ-45]] style of connector. This is commonly used between floors on a building.

### Standard/Subscriber Connector (SC)

This is a fiber optic cable that uses a push-pull connector similar to [[Coaxial Cables#RCA|audio and video plugs]]. Like the [[#Local/Lucent Connector (LC)|LC connector]] it is also used between the floors of a building.

## Cable Types

### Single Mode Fiber (SMF)

This type of cable only allows light to enter at a single angle. This can span for greate distances.

### Multimode Fiber (MMF)

This type of cable allows light to reflect off the walls of the cable, however it is only made for short distances.
