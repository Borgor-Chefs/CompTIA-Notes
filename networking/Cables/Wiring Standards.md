# Wiring Standards

These are the wiring standards created by TIA/EIA, namely:

- [[#568a|568a]]
- [[#568b|568b]]

These standards define how the "twisted pair cables" (colored wires) should be connected to an [[Digital Cables#Register Jack 45 (RJ-45) (Ethernet Cable)|RJ-45]] connector. There is no difference in functionality between both standards.

There are also types of cables which refer to what standard both ends of the wire follow:

- the most wiring standard is a [[#Straight Cable|straight cable]]
- the [[#Cross-over Cable|cross-over cable]]
- the [[#Rollover Cable|rollover cable]]
- the [[#Loopback Cable|loopback cable]]

## Standards

### 568a

See below how the wiring should look like for the 568a standard:

### 568b

See below how the wiring should look like for the 568b standard:

## Cable Types

### Straight Cable

This means that both ends of the cable follow the same standard, this is the most common type of cable and it is used to connect computers to hubs, switches or modems.

### Cross-over Cable

This is where each end is wired differently and are used to connect two similar devices together such as two computers together without using a hub or a switch. They are also used to connect hubs and switches together.

### Rollover Cable

This is created when both ends are wired completley opposite of each other. This is used to connect a compueter or a terminal to a router's console port.

### Loopback Cable

This is used to testing purposes, namely to trick the computer into thinking that it's connected to a network. To create a loopback cable, connect pin 1 to pin 3 and pin 2 to pin 6.
