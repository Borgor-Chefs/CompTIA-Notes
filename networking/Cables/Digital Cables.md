## Connectors

### Register Jack 11 (RJ-11)

![[Pasted image 20220828203527.png]]

The RJ-11 is a 4-wire telephone jack used for connecting phones to landlines. This type of cable is also used to connect modems on computers. Used to connect computers to LANs through the computer's modem. It locks itself in place using a hinged locking tab.

This connector resembles the [[|RJ-45]] connector but smaller.

### Register Jack 45 (RJ-45) (Ethernet Cable)

This is the most common networking connector, its most common use is to connect a computer to a local area network (LAN). It is used to attach [[Network Interface Card|network interface cards]] to hubs or switches.

This resembles the [[|RJ-11]] but larger. It also used twisted pair cabling.

### Firewire (IEEE 1394)

This type of cable is recognized by its 'D' shape and is commonly associated with attaching peripheral devices such as digital cameras and printers than network connections.

This is found on many type of video and multimedia devices.

### Universal Serial Bus

The USB cable is recognizeable by its signature trident logo.

This is the most common port you will see on any device. But there are also different types of USB connectors as shown below.

See [[IO Interfaces|here]] for the speeds of USB technology.

#### Type-A

![[Pasted image 20220828211004.png]]

This was the initial type of USB connector, used to attach peripherals such as cameras, keyboards, etc. This is now being phased out in favor of the type-C connector.

![[Pasted image 20220828211604.png]]

There are SuperSpeed variations of this cable upon the release of USB 3.0 but have now been phased out completely.

#### Type-B

This type of connector was released around the same time as the type-A connector. This is now being phased out in favor of the type-C connector.

![[Pasted image 20220828211611.png]]

There are SuperSpeed variations of this cable upon the release of USB 3.0 but have now been phased out completely.

#### Type-C

![[Pasted image 20220828211618.png]]

Initially released in 2014 this is meant to replace the type-A and type-B connectors.

#### Mini USB

![[Pasted image 20220828211535.png]]

These connectors were developed for smaller devices such as digital cameras, smartphones and tablet computers. They were initially released in April 2000 but have now been phased out around the time of USB 3.0 and in favor of the type-C connector.

#### Micro USB

![[Pasted image 20220828211543.png]]

These connectors were developed for even smaller devices like smartphones, PDAs and cameras. It was also meant to replace the bigger [[|mini USB]]. This connector was initially released in January 2007 but have now been phased out around the time of USB 3.2 and in favor of the type-C connector.

There were SuperSpeed variations of this cable upon the release of USB 3.0 but have now been phased out completely.

### Thunderbolt

![[Pasted image 20220828205147.png]]

A newer technology released in 2011. This is a high speed interface that outputs one serial signal from a combination of [[Bus Slots|PCIe]] and the [[IO Interfaces|DisplayPort]] interfaces. This was mainly used in Apple products but has now come to the PC.

![[Pasted image 20220828205201.png]]

Versions 1 & 2 uses a mini [[IO Interfaces|DisplayPort]] port whilst version 3 (type 3) uses the USB type-C port.

## Twisted Pair Cables

### Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) Cable

This is the most common type of cable used today, wires are twisted around each other to prevent EM interference (crosstalk). The greater number of twists, the better prevention of interference.

### Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) Cable

This is basically the exact same as an UTP cable however, there is a layer of metal shielding which surrounds the wires. This shielding adds a later of protection against EM interference.
