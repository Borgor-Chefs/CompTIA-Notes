# Internet Access Technologies

These are technologies which allow for access to the internet.
Here are some types:

- [[#Digital Subcriber Line (DSL)|DSL]]
	- [[#Asymmetric DSL (ADSL)|ADSL]]
	- [[#Symmetric DSL (SDSL)|SDSL]]
	- [[#Very High Bit Rate DSL (VDSL)|VDSL]]
- [[#Broadband Cable|Broadband Cable]]
- [[#Telephone Lines|Telephone Lines]]
	- [[#POTS/PSTN|Plain Old Telephone Service / Public Switched Telephone Network]]
	- [[#Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]]
- [[#Satellite|Satellite]]

## Digital Subcriber Line (DSL)

A popular technology used by homes and businesses to access broadband data over the internet. It uses a DSL modem that talks to telephone to carry its data.
This is a high speed connection that is much faster than dial-up modems.

This technology can carry both voice and data at the same time.

### Asymmetric DSL (ADSL)

This is where the upload and download lines are separate.
The download speed is considerably faster than the upload speed.

This is typically used in homes and is the cheapest form of DSL.

### Symmetric DSL (SDSL)

This is where the upload and download lines are separate.
The download and upload speeds are the same.

This is typically used in businesses.

### Very High Bit Rate DSL (VDSL)

This is a very fast form of DSL, the download speeds range over 50 Mbps over copper wire.
Because this technology uses copper wire, it's made for short distances.

For long distances, VDSL can use fiber optic cable.

## Broadband Cable

This is a direct link to the ISP, this is largely the technology of choice when it comes for homes. Speeds range from 50 Mbps or more.

The cable modem is attached to an external [[Coaxial Cables|coaxial cable]] which leads to the ISP.

Cable is typically provided by the same provider that provides cable television to customers.

## Telephone Lines

### POTS/PSTN

These are older telephone lines which are becoming obsolete because of their slow speeds (56 Kbps).

They do have an advantage, they are cheap and almost everywhere.

### Integrated Services Digital Network

This is the international standard for digital transmission over ordinary telephone lines.
There is a significant speed improvement from 56 Kpbs to 128 Kpbs.

This never really caught on because of the speeds of [[#Broadband Cable|cable]] and [[#Digital Subcriber Line (DSL)|DSL]].

## Satellite

This is quite expensive and not used very much due to this.
This technology is only really used where no proper infrastructure exists.

The download speed of this tech is 15 MBps (megabytes) with only a fraction of this in upload speeds.

The newest iteration of this technology is Starlink by Elon Musk.

## Mobile Phones

### Hotspots

These are devices that use cellular networks to connect wireless devices to the internet.
You typically find these built-in to your phone or it will be it's own dedicated device.

Hotspots are available through your carriers.

## Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP)

I have no idea dawg.
