# Internet Access Technologies

These are technologies which allow for access to the internet. Here are some types:

- [[#Digital Subcriber Line (DSL)|DSL]]
	- [[#Asymmetric DSL (ADSL)|ADSL]]
	- [[#Symmetric DSL (SDSL)|SDSL]]
	- [[#Very High Bit Rate DSL (VDSL)|VDSL]]
- [[#Broadband Cable|Broadband Cable]]
- [[#Telephone Lines|Telephone Lines]]
	- [[#POTS/PSTN|Plain Old Telephone Service / Public Switched Telephone Network]]
	- [[#Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]]
- [[#Satellite|Satellite]]
- [[#Mobile Phones|Mobile Phones]]
	- [[#Hotspots|Hotspots]]
- [[#Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP)|WISP]]
- [[#Metro Ethernet]]

Most of these connections use [[!Cables|copper cables]] as the medium to transfer data, these are usually cheap, but not the fastest possible connection you can obtain.

[[Fiber Optic Cables]] are the hot new medium used, but are more expensive because of the required equipment and experienced personnel required to maintain or repair these networks. ISPs will generally use fiber optic cables internally to speed up their internal networks. But, fiber is slowly approaching customers, however, this really depends on where you are geographically and if your local ISP has the infrastructure to do so.

## Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

A popular technology used by homes and businesses to access broadband data over the internet. It uses a DSL [[Modem]] that talks to telephone to carry its data.

This is a high speed connection that is much faster than dial-up modems. This technology can carry both voice and data at the same time.

### Asymmetric DSL (ADSL)

This is where the upload and download lines are separate. The download speed is considerably faster than the upload speed. This is typically used in homes and is the cheapest form of DSL.

This form of DSL usually uses [[!Cables|copper cables]]. There is about a 10,000ft limitation from the central office because of the copper cabling. The most common speeds of ADSL are 200Mbit/s downstream and 20Mbit/s upstream.

It's possible to obtain faster speeds if you are physically closer to the central office.

### Symmetric DSL (SDSL)

This is where the upload and download lines are separate. The download and upload speeds are the same.

This is typically used in businesses.

### Very High Bit Rate DSL (VDSL)

This is a very fast form of DSL, the download speeds range over 50Mbit/s over [[!Cables|copper wire]]. Because this technology uses copper wire, it's made for short distances.

For long distances, VDSL can use [[Fiber Optic Cables]].

## Broadband Cable

This is a direct link to the ISP, this is largely the technology of choice when it comes for homes. Speeds range from 50Mbit/s up to 1,000Mbit/s. The cable [[Modem]] is attached to an external [[Coaxial Cables|coaxial cable]] which leads to the ISP.

Cable is typically provided by the same provider that provides cable television to customers.

The specification used for this type of internet connection is called "Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification" (DOCSIS).

## Telephone Lines

### POTS/PSTN

These are older telephone lines which are becoming obsolete because of their slow speeds (56Kbit/s).

They do have an advantage; they are cheap and almost everywhere.

### Integrated Services Digital Network

This is the international standard for digital transmission over ordinary telephone lines. There is a significant speed improvement from 56Kbit/s to 128Kbit/s.

This never really caught on because of the speeds of [[#Broadband Cable|cable]] and [[#Digital Subcriber Line (DSL)|DSL]].

## Satellite

This is quite expensive and not used very much due to this. This technology is only really used where no proper infrastructure exists.

The download speed of this tech is 15Mbit/s with only a fraction of this in upload speeds.

>The newest iteration of this technology is Starlink by Elon Musk.

## Mobile Phones

### Hotspots

These are devices that use cellular networks to connect wireless devices to the internet.
You typically find these built-in to your phone or it will be it's own dedicated device.

Hotspots are available through your carriers.

## Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP)

I have no idea dawg.

## Metro Ethernet

These are found in [[Network Types#Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)|metropolitan area networks]] or contained regional areas and are used to connect various corporate sites together. Your ISP will give you a simple ethernet cable to connect your sites together.

Internally, on the ISP side, this is usually a fiber optic connection.
