# The Tape Drive

The tape drive is an old and inexpensive way of backing up data from your hard drive.

The storage medium is "tapes" which contain film to record data on. These are similar if not the same to the tapes which play music.

This attaches to a computer usually by a [[IO Interfaces#^1d9a68|USB]] cable.

Data is also stored sequentially, where if you were to restore the data you would restore the data in the same order as you backed it up.
