# Random Access Memory (RAM) Slots

RAM sticks (circuit boards / pieces) are installed on the [[The Motherboard|motherboard]] in specific RAM slots and sometimes in specific configurations.

Most motherboards have between 2 and 4 RAM slots.

The terms 32-bit and 64-bit data path refer to the amount of bits which are transferred in a single clock cycle. The more bits transferred, the faster the speed of the RAM.

## Slot Types

There are types of RAM slots which use specific types of RAM sticks.

### Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)

The most common type of RAM slots are DIMM slots.

A DIMM can have 168, 184 or 240 pins. Each DIMM has 2 independent rows of pins, one for each side.

DIMMs have a 64-bit data path.

### Single Inline Memory Module (SIMM)

An older technology replaced by the faster DIMM module.

SIMMs have redundant pins on both sides of the stick.

SIMMs have a 32-bit data path.

### Rambus Inline Memory Module

This was a type of RAM technology developed by Rambus Inc.

This type of RAM has 184 pins and resembles a DIMM. However the notches of the RIMM are in the middle of the stick.

RIMMs never fully caught on because of the advancement in DIMM technology.
