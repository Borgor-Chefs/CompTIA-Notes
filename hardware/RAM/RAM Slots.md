# Random Access Memory (RAM) Slots

[[RAM|RAM]] sticks (circuit boards / pieces) are installed on the [[The Motherboard|motherboard]] in specific RAM slots and sometimes in specific configurations.

Most motherboards have between 2 and 4 [[RAM|RAM]] slots.

The terms 32-bit and 64-bit data path refer to the amount of bits which are transferred in a single clock cycle. The more bits transferred, the faster the speed of the [[RAM|RAM]].

## Slot Types

There are types of [[RAM|RAM]] slots which use specific types of RAM sticks.

### Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)

The most common type of [[RAM|RAM]] slots are DIMM slots.

A DIMM can have 168, 184 or 240 pins. Each DIMM has 2 independent rows of pins, one for each side.

DIMMs have a 64-bit data path.

### Single Inline Memory Module (SIMM)

An older technology replaced by the faster [[#^7a04f0|DIMM]] module.

SIMMs have redundant pins on both sides of the stick.

SIMMs have a 32-bit data path.

### Rambus Inline Memory Module (RIMM)

This was a type of [[RAM|RAM]] technology developed by Rambus Inc.

This type of [[RAM|RAM]] has 184 pins and resembles a [[#^7a04f0|DIMM]]. However the notches of the RIMM are in the middle of the stick.

RIMMs never fully caught on because of the advancement in [[#^7a04f0|DIMM]] technology.

### Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module (SODIMM)

This is a type of [[RAM|RAM]] that is used in smaller devices such as laptops. These are half the size of [[#^7a04f0|DIMMs]]. These also come in different types such as [[RAM#^3f049c|DDR]], [[RAM#^78fa7d|DDR2]] and [[RAM#^0a74fc|DDR3]]. It is also important to note that these types are **not** compatible with each other.
