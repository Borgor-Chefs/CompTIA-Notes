# The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)

BIOS stands for "Basic Input/Output System" and it is the first thing to run on a computer when it starts up. The BIOS is stored within a chip on the motherboard and is powered (to retain data) by the CMOS battery.

## Functions

- It is firmware software that establishes the abse behavior of a computer
- It sets the hardware configuration of the computer
- It tells the computer what hardware to initialize and in what order (a.k.a. priority)
- The BIOS points out to the PC the files which are needed in order to boot up the operating system

## Properties

- The BIOS is stored in nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM)
- It is designed and coded for a specific motherboard
- BIOS updates can add functionality to a system that wasn't originally present

## How do I access the BIOS?

Usually, when booting up a computer there is a window of time that you can press a specific key such as an F-key or another special key to open up the BIOS menu.

## Why would I need to access the BIOS?

Sometimes when you add a new component to a PC you'll need to update some of the settings within the BIOS to work properly with the new hardware.

Accessing the BIOS might also be important with system recovery.

## How do I update the BIOS?

You'll need to download the update (which is usually a .exe file) and then run it to update the BIOS. Sometimes you'll need to swap operating systems in case the BIOS update file can't run on your system (e.g., you've downloaded a .exe file on some Linux distribution).

If the update fails or something along those lines, this is very bad since the BIOS is required for the computer to update. If the update fails and the BIOS is now corrupted, you'll either need to flash a valid copy of the BIOS to some chip on the motherboard or you will need to buy another motherboard.
