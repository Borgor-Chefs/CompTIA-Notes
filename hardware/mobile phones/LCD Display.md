# Liquid-Crystal Display

This is a technology for screens for mobile phones, this is a flat-panel display that uses the "light-modulating properties" of liquid crystals combined with polarizers.

This display doesn't actually produce light and requires a backlight in order for it to produce a visible image.

This is the disassembly of a [[LCD Display#Twisted Nematic|twisted nematic]] LCD display, where:

1.  [Polarizing filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizer "Polarizer") film with a vertical axis to polarize light as it enters.
2.  Glass substrate with [ITO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_tin_oxide "Indium tin oxide") [electrodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode "Electrode"). The shapes of these electrodes will determine the shapes that will appear when the LCD is switched ON. Vertical ridges etched on the surface are smooth.
3.  Twisted nematic liquid crystal.
4.  Glass substrate with common electrode film (ITO) with horizontal ridges to line up with the horizontal filter.
5.  Polarizing filter film with a horizontal axis to block/pass light.
6.  Reflective surface to send light back to viewer. (In a backlit LCD, this layer is replaced or complemented with a light source.)

## Active Matrix Technologies

This is a technology where each pixel has a small transistor and a capacitor which enable it to be turned on or off. This technology costs more than a passive matrix LCD because of this.

### In-Plane Switching

>[In-plane switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel "IPS panel") is an LCD technology that aligns the liquid crystals in a plane parallel to the glass substrates. In this method, the electrical field is applied through opposite electrodes on the same glass substrate, so that the liquid crystals can be reoriented (switched) essentially in the same plane, although fringe fields inhibit a homogeneous reorientation.

### Twisted Nematic

This is where the crystals rotate themselves to allow light to pass through. Only works when powered.

### Vertical Alignment

>Vertical-alignment displays are a form of LCDs in which the liquid crystals naturally align vertically to the glass substrates. When no voltage is applied, the liquid crystals remain perpendicular to the substrate, creating a black display between crossed polarizers. When voltage is applied, the liquid crystals shift to a tilted position, allowing light to pass through and create a gray-scale display depending on the amount of tilt generated by the electric field.
