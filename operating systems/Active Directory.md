# Active Directory

This is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows networks. It stores information about objects on a network (such as printers, computers, users, etc.) in a hierarchical structure to easily manage permissions and control access to network resources.

Think of it as a database which stores information about printers, scanners, computers, users along with their permissions.

This acts like a phonebook or a reference sheet for users to look up and easily manage devices on their network. It provides an efficient way for admins to manage the security settings of their organization's IT infrastructure.

The way to interface with this service is via. Group Policy.

Here's how to appreciate active directory; when you want to add a new user to your company system, instead of walking around to each new computer and configuring it manually, why not automate this process programmatically? Better yet, doing this programmatically, you don't have to get up out of your chair to go to each computer and you can almost eliminate any human error for configuration.
