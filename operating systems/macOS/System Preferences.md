# System Preferences

This is macOS's equivalent to Windows' [[Control Panel|control panel]], you can change almost everything about your system from this app.

>This is pretty much the exact same as Control Panel, just written by Apple. You can modify wired and wireless network connections, change display resolution and brightness, put on child locks, create accounts and manage users, etc.
