## macOS

This is like a proprietary version of [[#Linux|Linux]] (I believe based on Debian) for the average consumer. It's almost like the Windows version of Linux targeted for consumers.

It's quite easy to use and has some nice features to make it a good daily driver. The main feature of macOS is its integration into the Apple software and hardware ecosystem.

- advantages
	- easy to use
	- relatively fewer security concerns
	- it's very similar to standard Linux and comes with all the classic Linux utilities
- disadvantages
	- will only run on Apple hardware
	- less industry/software support than the Windows platform
	- way too costly compared to what you get
		- Apple is not cheap and they love to price gouge you for repairs or anything Apple related really

>Keep in mind that macOS has its own executable format, the `.app` extension. I don't think native Linux programs (ELF files) will work due to either libraries being unavailable or a matter of file format.

>Any computer that isn't an Apple product that's running macOS is called a "Hackintosh".

## iOS

This is the operating system that runs on iPhones. This OS is based on Unix and is absolutely proprietary. This OS is exclusive to iPhones and will not run on anything else.

>iOS apps are developed with iOS SDK on [[#macOS|macOS]] with all apps having to be approved by Apple before they get released onto the Apple App Store.

## iPadOS

This is Apple's OS for iPads, which is a variant of iOS for iPhones. The main features that make this OS different from iOS are:

- a desktop browser version of Safari
- able to be used as a second monitor (sidecar)
- keyboard support
- multitasking, able to run multiple apps simultaneously
