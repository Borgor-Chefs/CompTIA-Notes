# Features

Here's a list of all the notable features from macOS:

- [[#Mission Control|Mission Control]]
- [[#Keychain|Keychain]]
- [[#Spotlight|Spotlight]]
- [[#iCloud|iCloud]]
- [[#Gestures|Gestures]]
- [[#Finder|Finder]]
- [[#Remote Disc|Remote Disc]]
- [[#Dock|Dock]]
- [[#Disk Utility|Disk Utility]]
- [[#FileVault|FileVault]]
- [[#Terminal|Terminal]]
- [[#Force Quit|Force Quit]]

## Mission Control

This does what alt+tab on Windows does, it takes all the windows open on your screen, displays them all on the single screen so you can visualize them and finally, you can move open applications to different virtual desktops (which are called "spaces").

## Keychain

This is Apple's built-in password manager, this manages passwords, notes, certificates, etc.

This application also has connectivity with iCloud so synchronize your passwords with other devices from the Apple ecosystem.

>This is a step up from Windows tbh.

## Spotlight

This is a built-in search engine that can fine files, images, apps but it also looks at the information inside of a file, image or app.

Here's a (non-definitive) list of places/things that are indexed by Spotlight:

- apps
- bookmarks & history
- calculator
- contacts
- conversation
- definition
- developer
- documents
- events & reminders
- folders
- fonts
- images
- mail & messages
- movies

>What can and cannot be indexed is controlled via. [[System Preferences|system preferences]].

## iCloud

This is a way to use Apple's infrastructure to synchronize key details such as calendars, photos, documents, contacts, backups, etc. across any and all of your Apple devices.

>Note that this is integrated into the operating system.

## Gestures

This is an hand-input device which is actually kinda cool, you can buy a touch-pad looking device that takes your input (e.g., swiping left or right with two fingers) and maps that to an action in your computer.

>This is under "Trackpad" in [[System Preferences|system preferences]].

## Finder

This is Apple's equivalent to Windows' File Explorer but I'd say it's more advanced since it has features like:

- tagging files and folders
- indexing another computer if that computer has screen sharing enabled
- airdrop

## Remote Disc

This is like Windows' network shares if your Mac has an [[CD-ROM|optical drive]], you can share this computer on the network to act as a central hub to read/write information from/to a CD.

>This will not work with audio CDs or video DVDs.
>This is setup in [[System Preferences|system preferences]].

## Dock

This is the taskbar. I don't really know why this video covers this like it's a brand new feature.

>Configurable via. [[System Preferences|system preferences]].

## Disk Utility

This applet manages partitions, checks the stats of the drive (e.g., space used, space free, disk health). You can also modify the disk's partitions, erase disks.

You can also create, convert and restore disk images.

## FileVault

This app provides full disk encryption (FDE) and uses either a local key or iCloud authentication in order to decrypt the drive.

Authentication is required before macOS can even start (which is good).

## Terminal

This is probably the single best feature, this is literally a Linux shell but for a mainstream OS. It includes the standard Linux utilities along with some other ones.

>The default shell is ZSH, which is pretty fucking sexy.

## Force Quit

Equivalent to Task Manager, you can kill or "force quit" an application that has become unresponsive.

>Press Command-Option-Escape to pull this up.
