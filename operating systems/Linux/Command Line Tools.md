# Linux Command Line Tools

- `man`
	- opens up the manual of an binary if `man` has one
- `ls`
	- prints out the contents of a directory
- `pwd`
	- prints out the current working directory
- `mv <SRC> <DEST>`
	- moves a file, can also be used to rename a file
- `cp <SRC> <DEST>`
	- copies a file
- `rm <FILE>
	- deletes a file
- `rmdir <DIR>`
	- removes an empty directory, can also use `rm -rf <DIR>` to delete the directory and its contents
- `chmod <MODE> <FILE>`
	- this changes the permissions of a file, see [[#Ownership Octal]]
	- where `MODE` is `[ugoa][+|-][rwx]` or `0000` to `0777` (octal)
		- `u` is for user
		- `g` is for group
		- `o` is for other
		- `a` is for everyone
		- `r` is for read access
		- `w` is for write access
		- `x` is for execute access
		- `+` is to add a permission (if not exists)
		- `-` is to remove a permission (if not exists)
- `chown <owner:group> <FILE>
	- changes the ownership of a file
- `su` substitute user
	- you can become another user, although it's pretty much mainly used to swap to root
- `sudo` superuser do
	- execute commands as root
- `file`
	- describes a file to the user, the file type, attributes, notes about it
		- will say if a binary is stripped or not, dynamically linked or not
	- this relies on the magic bytes of a file
- `ip`
	- a huge command, used for networking
- `df` disk free
	- shows the amount of free space on the system, where the block is mounted, etc.
	- use `-h` for human-readable values e.g., gigabytes, megabytes, etc.'
- `grep PATTERN [FILE]`
	- matches pattern against strings either from a file or from STDIN
- `ps`
	- lists all currently running processes, their PID, state and what binary is associated with it
	- `ps aux` is probably the most useful since it will list ALL processes
- `top` (just install `htop`)
	- a better `ps` since it shows PID, user, memory usage, cpu usage, load and a bunch of other key information
- `find` finds a file
	- this is a very complex command but the basic usage is `find [DIR] -name [PATTERN]`
	- this command is extremely configurable but limited in what you want to do if you want to execute a command per file
- `dig`
	- lookup information from DNS servers, shows canonical names, IP addresses, cache timers, etc.
	- I don't think this is a default Linux utility, I've personally never heard of it before
- `cat ...` concatenates files
	- this program reads the contents of anything given to it and writes it to STDOUT
	- very useful for file manipulation along with pipelines
- `sed` stream editing
	- a powerful command whose sole purpose is to edit streams of text (using regular expressions)
- `nano` (you're a scrub if you use this, use `vim` instead)
	- a simple text editor that's usually installed with every single Linux distro
	- this is STUPID, install `vim` instead and be based

## Ownership Octal

|#|Permission|Representation|
|-|-|-|
|7|Read, write, execute|`rwx`|
|6|Read and write|`rw-`|
|5|Read and execute|`r-x`|
|4|Read only|`r--`|
|3|Write and execute|`-wx`|
|2|Write only|`-w-`|
|1|Execute only|`--x`|
|0|None|`---`|

Given the format `?XXXYYYZZZ` of any file, the string is divided into 4 groups:

- `?` used to show special file attributes
	- if no special attributes, it will display as `-`
	- `B` for a block file (usually a storage medium found in `/dev`)
	- `C` for character file (usually a terminal or graphical display I'm pretty sure)
	- `L` for a symbolic link
	- `D` for a directory
	- `S` for a socket (networking, usually)
- `XXX` for the user permission octal
- `YYY` for the group permission octal
- `ZZZ` for the others permission octal
