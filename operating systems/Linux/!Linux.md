# About Linux

- for features, see [[Linux Features]]
- for linux command line tools, see [[comptia a+/operating systems/Linux/Tools/Command Line Tools|Command Line Tools]]

This is *like* Unix, not *is* Unix. There are probably thousands of distributions at this point, most of which are based on a singular architecture/flavor of Linux.

- advantages
	- it's absolutely free
	- everything on your computer is open-source
		- meaning that you can change it at any time but more importantly you can see what it does and how it behaves
	- works on a large variety of hardware (OpenBSD is a great example)
	- a very passionate and active user community
- disadvantages
	- limited driver support, especially with laptops
		- looking at you Nvidia
	- limited support options
	- somewhat limited application support, especially for gaming
		- if something only runs on [[#Windows|Windows]], your best bet is either find something else or find a way to emulate it, like Wine
	- requires knowledge of computers beyond the surface level, usually a familiarity with programming

>This is the single best operating system.
