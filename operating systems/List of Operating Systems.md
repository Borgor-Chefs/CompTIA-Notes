# List of Operating Systems

Here are the most common operating systems available to the public:

- [[#Windows|Windows]]
- [[!Linux|Linux]]
- [[!Apple|Apple]]
- [[#ChromeOS|ChomeOS]]
- [[#Google Android|Android]]
- [[#Vendor Specific Software|Vendor Specific Software]]

## Windows

This is by far the most common operating system used in the market for consumers, prosumers and corporations and has the largest market share.

- advantages
	- large industry and tech support
	- large software support; most applications and video games run on Windows
- disadvantages
	- prone to hacks and security exploits
	- large hardware support can create challenging integration exercises
	- odds are you paid for Windows
	- absolutely proprietary
	- spyware is probably installed on your PC by default along with a couple three-letter agency backdoors built-in
	- it's Windows

## ChromeOS

This is basically laptop: cloud edition. This is Google's operating system which is based on the [[#Linux|Linux]] kernel (as so many thing are). This centers around the Chrome web browser.

They are relatively cheap and come from numerous manufacturers, however, they rely on the cloud and **must** have an internet connection.

## Google Android

This is an open-source operating system based on [[#Linux|Linux]] but it's really semi-open-source because when this OS gets installed onto a phone by any manufacturer, it comes prepackaged with closed-source Google apps which are innately spooky.

However, the main driver is open-source and that's what mainly matters since you can remove all the Google utilities from your phone.

>Android apps can be developed on [[#Windows|Windows]], [[#macOS|macOS]], [[#Linux|Linux]] with the Android SDK. Apps are available from the Google Play store but can be side-loaded or installed via. `.apk` files.
>Apps are also available from third-party sites such as the Amazon Appstore.

## Vendor Specific Software

Vendor specific software is mainly for things such as routers, switches, mainly any networking equipment along or other devices.

The support of this software and or hardware is dependent on the vendor that supplies it, it could be either really good and setup to be maintained for a long time or shitty and the end of life will be three years after launch.

One thing to note is the application compatibility and the operating system compatibility. If your workplace uses macOS for example but the piece of software or hardware you need only runs on Windows or has a driver only for Windows, then you're kind of out of luck.

>Webapps should be immune to this rule since they (should) only rely on the browser and not the hardware.
>E.g., it should not matter if an Apple, Windows or Linux computer accesses a Shaw or Broadcom router from their browser.
