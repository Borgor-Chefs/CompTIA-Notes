# OS User Requirements

The main goal of an operating system is to be the tool which the user requires in order to complete their task.

Your average user will require the following:

- a graphical desktop
- a way to retrieve, store, rename and organize files in a hierarchical structure
- a place to store files without them being lost or corrupted
- a way to access the internet or a network
- some form of entertainment
	- this is usually either YouTube (internet) or a video game
- an email client
- tools to help them create:
	- spreadsheets
	- documents
	- slideshows
- a calculator
- some method to configure their operating system (in the visual or behavioral sense)
- input and output support
	- keyboards and mice
	- external storage drives
- printer support

More advanced users might require features such as:

- low-level access to both software and hardware components such as the network card, the kernel, drivers, etc.
	- including low-level configuration
- a scripting language to interface with the operating system
- tools to view networking devices
- packet sniffers
- programming language build tools
- specific architectures
- additional hardware/driver support for third-party systems such as:
	- complex sound systems
	- drawing tablets
	- cameras

IT administrators would require:

- tools to remotely push and pull networking configuration to computers, routers, switches or any other networking device (think [[Active Directory]])
