# Upgrade Methods

This is all about how to upgrade windows and the two methods that can be used. This is different from installing because upgrading only touches the operating system files and nothing created by the user whereas installing entails wiping the entire system and starting fresh.

This retains certain configurations such as user preferences (e.g., hotbar color, keybinds, etc.) along with preserving the local accounts.

Upgrading is preferred over a new install because it saves hours of time in; reinstalling the applications that were removed, keeps user data and is easier to get up and running. If you do not care about those points then reinstalling can fix things such as a botched install, a fucked registry and to remove any programs and or viruses that might be plaguing your system.

## Performing an Upgrade

When we use the term "upgrade your computer" we generally mean "upgrade your kernel and other system files, retaining all your files". This is referred to as an "in-place upgrade" since we are not wiping the entire computer, just replacing system files, keeping all the applications, documents and settings.

A "clean install" is wiping everything off of your computer and starting fresh. This means; removing all the installed applications, documents, any and all configurations for all users present on the system.

## Upgrade/Install Media

In the modern age, we generally don't boot from a [[CD-ROM|CD]] anymore, instead we either boot from a USB that was turned into an install tool via. some Windows media creation tool.

>Or, if you're cool like Linux is, I believe kernel upgrades are hotswappable, meaning that kernel upgrades/changes can be applied on the fly without having to reboot.

One thing to note is that you cannot upgrade from a 32-bit Windows version to a 64-bit version or vice-versa, you'll have to "migrate" your install to this new platform. Migrating here means that you'll have to backup all your files and perform a clean install of the desired architecture.

### Upgrades Between Editions

Let's say that you wanted to upgrade from the Windows 10 Home edition to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 11 Pro edition. This is entirely possible, however sometimes you cannot upgrade from edition A to edition B, you'd have to see if Microsoft has made this possible (on their website).

For example, you can perform an in-place upgrade from Windows 7/8 to Windows 10 (but not Windows 8.1 to Windows 10).

### Upgrade Doesn't Work Properly

Sometimes when installing, Windows won't update itself to the latest version of the target edition (e.g., the latest version of Windows 10), that said, you will often have to install more upgrades such as; service packs, security patches/applications, driver updates and application updates.
