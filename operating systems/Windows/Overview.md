# An Overview of Windows

On the 220-1102 a+ exam, you will be tested on the two versions of Windows; 10 and 11. CompTIA considers all **in-support** Windows versions to be in scope for the exam.

Note that mainstream support is up until 5 years after release. Windows versions are listed in the objectives, everything else includes both Windows 10 and 11. Fortunately, there's no very much difference at all so if you know one you know the other.
