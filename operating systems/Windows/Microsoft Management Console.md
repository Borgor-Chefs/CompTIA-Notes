This is kinda like an all-in-one type of deal to manage and maintain your installation of Windows.

To open this program search `mmc.exe` (or just `mmc`) either in the `Run` prompt or just by searching it after pressing the Windows key.

This is actually very useful as instead of launching disk management, task scheduler all individually, you can all group them and launch them from this single program. Programs such as:

- [[Event Viewer|event viewer]]
- [[Local Users and Groups|local users and groups]]
- [[Disk Management|disk management]]
- [[Task Scheduler|task scheduler]]
- [[Performance Monitor|performance]]
- [[Group Policy Editor|local computer policy]]
- [[Disk Management|disk management]]
- [[Device Manager|device manager]]
- [[Certificate Manager|certificate manager]]
