# Windows Defender

>Comes pre-installed on Windows 10 & 11.

This is Windows' built-in anti-virus protection. Sometimes, this is a pain in the ass because it blocks certain applications from running. In order to test whether or not Windows Defender is preventing an application from running or working correctly, disable this program and test again.

>REMEMBER TO ALWAYS RE-ENABLE WINDOWS DEFENDER AFTER DISABLING IT.
