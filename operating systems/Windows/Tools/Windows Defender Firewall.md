# Windows Defender Firewall

This is the built-in firewall for Windows and comes shipped with every single [[Windows Editions|edition]]. You can disable this firewall manually by opening [[Control Panel|control panel]] and clicking the "Windows Defender Firewall" applet.

Just like [[Windows Network Technologies#Network Privacy|network profiles]], Windows Defender has a public and private option for networks where you can automatically enable/disable the firewall when connected to a public or private network.

>Disabling Windows Defender Firewall requires elevated permissions.

You can also block all incoming connections, including those in the list of the allowed apps. Any app that wants to do anything networking related, it must first ask the firewall for permission.
