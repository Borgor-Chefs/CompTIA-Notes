# Event Viewer

This is a centralized logging tool for the Windows operating system. There are by default five types of logs here:

- application
	- information logged by applications hosted on the local machine
- security
	- information related to login attempts (success and failure), elevated privileges and other audited events
- system
	- messages generated by Windows
- setup
	- messages generated when installing and upgrading the Windows operating system. If the Windows system is a domain controller, those messages are also logged here
- forwarded events
	- events forwarded by other computers when the local machine is functioning as a central subscriber

For each log there are six levels of severity:

- information
- warning
- error
- critical
- successful audit
- failure audit
