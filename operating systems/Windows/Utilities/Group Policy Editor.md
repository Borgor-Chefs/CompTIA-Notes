# Group Policy Editor

This tool allows for the central management of users and systems. You'd only use this in a company setting where they employ [[Active Directory|active directory]].

This allows you to set rules such as:

- application restrictions
- security policies
- application control
- password age, length, complexity, reset, encryption
