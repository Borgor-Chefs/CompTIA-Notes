# Local Users and Groups

This tool allows you to manage all users and groups on your local machine along with their permissions.

You can control:

- the default administrator user
- the default guest user
- default groups
- any created groups
- any created users
- add users to groups
- remove users from groups

And each of those users/groups permissions.
