# System Configuration

This is mainly used to mange boot processes, startup, services, etc. You can:

- enable safe boot
	- minimal safe boot
	- an alternate shell
	- active directory repair
- a non-GUI boot
- a boot log
- base video (idk what this means)
- show OS boot information

Along with making all boot settings permanent.
