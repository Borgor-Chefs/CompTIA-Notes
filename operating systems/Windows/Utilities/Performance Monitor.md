# Performance Monitor

This tool is used to gather long-term statistics about your local machine. You can gather metrics such as:

- disk usage
- memory usage
- CPU usage
- GPU usage

You can also setup alerts and automated actions based on the usage of a certain resource.

Finally, you can save and store statistics to analyze long-term trends of your computer. This could help in diagnosing hardware issues. Perhaps if your CPU is always running at 100% capacity you need a newer, faster CPU. Or, if your memory usage is always high, you might need more memory for your day to day usage or work load.

You can also generate reports via. the click of a button.
