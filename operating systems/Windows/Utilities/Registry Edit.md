# Registry Edit

This edits the Windows registry which is a use database of key-value pairs that control applications. This is also laid out in a hierarchical structure.

This is used by almost everything:

- kernel
- device drivers
- services
- security account manager
- user interface
- applications

It's a best practice to make a backup of the registry before you change any of the registry keys.
