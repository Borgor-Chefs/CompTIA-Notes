# Device Manager

This tool displays all installed drivers and or any connected hardware devices such as:

- disk drives
- audio inputs and outputs
	- microphones
	- speakers
	- headsets
- printers
- scanners
- DVD/CD-ROM drives
- human interface devices
- IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers
- the computer itself (the CPU specifically)
- cameras

>Note that device drivers are hardware specific and operating system specific. Older drivers many not work in Windows 10 or Windows 11. Something to watch out for.
