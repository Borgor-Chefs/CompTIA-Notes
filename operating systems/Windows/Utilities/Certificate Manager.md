# Certificate Manager

These are cryptographic files that authenticate traffic from servers. This is what verifies servers to ensure that they are the real deal. These certificates come from OpenSSL I believe and there is a large network of certificate authorities to regulate these.

This allows you to manage certificates from:

- personal locations
- trusted root certificates
- enterprise trust
- intermediate certificates
- active directory
- trusted people
- untrusted certificates
- trusted publishers

And other places.
